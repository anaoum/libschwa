DONE * handle the end apostrophe on plural possessives (currently treated as an open quote)
  - using a hack to check whether the next character is a whitespace or not
  - would prefer a solution where transitions to whitespace worked rather than a lookahead
    not quite clear how to do that yet in Ragel

DONE * handle ambiguous sentence terminators by looking at the capitalisation of the next word
  - was only failing when the next word is a contraction

DONE * handle $US111.111 (currently $ US111. 111 not $US 111.111)
  - must remember that regular expressions in Ragel don't support +

DONE * handle nasty cases like O'Connor's (the apostrophe gets a double count)
  - the workaround is not very pretty since it involves compiling out apostrophes, but it works

* handle contractions with 'n (like rock'n'roll but with spaces)
* handling sentence ending abbreviations with a period (mainly a.m. and p.m. are problems in death notices) [smh062 etc.]
* numbered lists [smh053]
* range values (years, times, ...)

DONE * closing parentheses after the sentence termination [smh057], and longer [smh063]
  - added more punctuation characters to end_punct_ calls (end parentheses, comma, ...)

DONE * strange float separation on decimal place [smh058]
  - not a bug, the original file actually has these separated (chess story?)
