THE Treasurer , Peter Costello , has exposed the bitterness at the core of the Federal Government by describing his leader , John Howard , as a failed economic manager .

`` The Howard treasurership was not a success in terms of interest rates and inflation , '' Mr Costello told the authors of a forthcoming book , adding : `` He had not been a great reformer . ''

With the Prime Minister about to appeal for a fifth term in power based largely on the economic credentials of his Government , these criticisms threaten to harm its credibility and unity .

The Treasurer also accuses Mr Howard of malicious leaking against his deputy and heir presumptive , suggesting the Prime Minister had deliberately leaked an infamous memo to damage him .

`` I read it as an attempt to finger me for the Government 's maladies at that point , '' Mr Costello said of the 2001 publication of a memo from the then federal president of the Liberal Party , Shane Stone , to Mr Howard .

`` Allegedly , only one copy was ever written by Shane and it was given to John Howard . ''

Two of the Prime Minister 's senior staff were deputised to investigate the leak and `` as far as I know they 're still doing it '' , Mr Costello told the authors .
`` It 's a long investigation this one . ''

And the book reports that , after 11 years in Government , John and Janette Howard have dined privately with various ministers and their wives but never as a foursome with Peter and Tanya Costello : `` It might be a Sydney thing , '' the Treasurer archly suggests .

The remarks were made to the authors of John Winston Howard : The Biography , to be published next week by Melbourne University Press .

One of the authors , Peter van Onselen , associate professor of politics at Edith Cowan University in Perth , said he had interviewed Mr Costello twice last year , in August and October .
The second author is Wayne Errington , a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University .

Mr Costello , whose leadership ambitions have been frustrated by Mr Howard 's tenure , portrays his forbearance as one of the Government 's great strengths .

He contrasts his patience with Mr Howard 's history : `` The rival ambitions of Howard and Peacock plunged the party into defeat in Opposition , '' he tells the authors .
`` They were prepared to do that .

`` Keating was prepared to do it to Hawke .
Whatever my own ambitions were , the party was always greater than them .
I think that 's been a big part of our success over the last 10 years . ''

Yet Mr Costello could not forbear to criticise his leader .
Mr Howard has described his deputy as `` the best treasurer Australia has had '' .
But Mr Costello gives Mr Howard 's term in the post , from 1977 to 1983 , a withering appraisal .

At the end of Mr Howard 's treasurership , inflation was running at 11 per cent and bank interest rates for home loans were 12.5 per cent .

Mr Costello challenges Mr Howard 's determination as a reformer and even his veracity in claiming to have attempted reform as treasurer .

Speaking of the Campbell inquiry 's recommendations for the deregulation of the financial sector under the prime ministership of Malcolm Fraser , he said : `` He [ Mr Howard ] would say to you now , ` Oh well , I was always in favour of it and Malcolm stopped it . '

`` You know , the truth of the matter is if he had really wanted to push it he could have pushed it . ''

Similarly , Mr Costello takes issue with Mr Howard 's record as a fiscally responsible treasurer .
While Mr Howard has since said he threatened to resign in protest at Mr Fraser 's profligacy , Mr Costello questions this : `` He was threatening resignation a long time after the event but there was no evidence at the time . ''

According to the authors , Mr Costello expresses concerns at the `` sustainability '' of the amount of money the Government is spending at the Prime Minister 's insistence .

`` I have to foot the bill and that worries me , '' Mr Costello said .
`` And then I start thinking about not just footing the bill today but if we keep building in all these things , footing the bill in five , and 10 and 15 years and you know I do worry about the sustainability of all these things . ''

Morale in the Coalition parties is low with Labor rampant in the polls .
And while Mr Howard is firmly entrenched as leader , many in the party wonder whether they should have appointed Mr Costello leader last year in an effort to give the party freshness and new energy .

The Treasurer adopts a stoic air in his interviews in the book .
Asked whether he feels betrayed by Mr Howard , who discussed with him the idea of stepping down after one and a half terms in his favour , he replies : `` What do you expect me to do ?
I do n't cry myself to sleep ...
The dogs bark but the caravan moves on . ''

And , according to the book , Mr Costello is still carrying the baggage .
