Trivest is an investment company that specialises in the development of heritage commercial and industrial sites.<p />The group's latest project is Alexandria Creative Park, formerly a linseed oil mill.<p />Encompassing 20,176 square metres on the corner of Huntley Street and Bourke Road, the business park will have 10 lettable buildings, including eight refurbished<p />heritage structures.<p />Two 18.6-metre concrete grain silos will be readapted to house four internal levels<p />with distinctive circular windows and an external glass and steel lift.<p />Trivest director Albert Bertini (pictured) says he will pay attention to the fi nishes<p />to retain and enhance the site's character, as he believes Alexandria is on the way to<p />becoming "the next city fringe". <p />"It used to be Pyrmont, Surry Hills and Broadway, but now you're paying<p />$495 a square metre at Pyrmont, and that's too expensive," he says. "I think this<p />is the next area to boom, offering a price difference of up to $100."<p />Bertini believes there is more demand than supply in south Sydney, with creative<p />businesses looking for unique spaces but finding themselves priced out of the<p />fringe market.<p />The Kann Finch Group are the architects for Alexandria Creative Park and associate<p />director Ron Keir says the site has a particular aesthetic that is related to big<p />factory spaces, with trusses, lots of height and gutsy structures.<p />"We've been involved in a number of Albert's projects and the formula is similar,"<p />Keir says. "He likes to work on buildings that have a heritage component and what makes it attractive is he likes to use the existing building envelope, which from an approving authority's perspective is a great thing.<p />We get to build some very nice spaces and some very beautiful industrial buildings."<p />Keir says there are plenty of creative organisations that want space that is "a<p />bit edgy", the kind of organisations that don't mind if the air-conditioning ducts and<p />electrical cables are visible.<p />"I think that for a long time now, employers and designers have understood<p />that the nature of the working environment is very important for inducing people to<p />stay at work, to enjoy their work," he says. <p />"Employees want to be proud of their work space and happy to invite others in. If you feel that your employer is doing something to make your work environment a little bit special, that fosters better results and keeps you motivated."<p />The Alexandria Creative Park will feature an on-site bar and brasserie<p />housed in a Federation cottage, which was once the administration building for<p />the oil mill. There will also be restaurants and gymnasiums, showrooms and lightindustrial warehousing.<p />While no leases have been signed to date, Bertini says he has one major<p />company looking at the whole site, along with interest from telcos, advertising<p />companies and fi lm-production fi rms, all attracted by the rent.<p />The refurbishment of the site is expected to start next month, with completion in<p />about nine months.<p />"It's a very unusual business park," Keir says. "Most are a bit cold and clinical,<p />the typical factory unit with an office on the first floor. This is the fi rst one that<p />has tried to integrate heritage industrial buildings into real creative working space.<p />It has all the benefi ts of the big spaces of a business park but also has unusual<p />ingredients creative people like."
