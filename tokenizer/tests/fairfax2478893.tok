Public outrage over the treatment of Australian cattle in Indonesian abattoirs has spilled into local sales of meat , with butchers reporting a drop in consumer demand after the exposure of animal cruelty .

The Australian Meat Industry Council , representing independent butchers who account for about half of all meat sales in the nation , reported a 10 to 15 per cent drop in sales since the ABC Four Corners program on cattle slaughtering in Indonesia aired at the start of last week .

`` Seeing what was the appalling and abhorrent treatment of animals upsets people 's values and makes them not want to eat meat , '' said AMIC spokesman Tom Maguire .
`` There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are turned away from the product , as well .

`` What you saw on the program would not happen in an Australian abattoir , '' Mr Maguire said , referring to the ABC program that aired on Monday May 30 .
`` The appalling cruelty that occurred is against Australian law . ''

Mr Maguire said Australian abattoirs have fully audited systems with animals stunned prior to slaughter .

The Gillard government late yesterday responded to public anger by announcing it would ban all live cattle exports to Indonesia until appropriate animal welfare safeguards are in place .

Indications of an economic fallout from the decision are appearing with major beef producer Australian Agricultural Company today entering a trading halt on the Australian stock exchange as the company examines the statement on the effect on it of the ban on live beef shipments to Indonesia .

`` We 're very supportive of what the federal government has done because it 's allowing us to get around the table and hopefully restore some community confidence in the industry , '' said Mr Maguire .

Despite the reported fall in meat sales , major supermarkets chain Woolworths said it had seen no difference in meat demand since the revelations were made public .

`` It appears Australian consumers have made the distinction between that which is exported to Indonesia and that which is completely home grown , '' said spokesman Benedict Brook .

Wesfarmers-owned Coles was not immediately available for comment .
