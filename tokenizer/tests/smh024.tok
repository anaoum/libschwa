Financial planners are recommending that their clients choose investments that result in a commission to the planner of more than 10 per cent .

Is this bad ?
For everyone -- the investor , the investment fund manager paying the commission , and even the planner -- it is extremely bad .

It is something of a small wonder commissions at these levels are still being paid to planners , after the Westpoint property group collapse .

And not just because investors are in effect paying 10 cents of their investment dollar into the pocket of a financial planner .

Up-front planner commissions for selling most investment products are in the range of 1 per cent to 2 per cent .

Westpoint 's success in obtaining funds for its shaky property-and-loans empire -- it collapsed in 2005 owing $ 300 million -- was partly based on high commissions for financial planners .

This point cannot be argued .
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has banned 15 financial planners who breached their duties when they advised their clientsthey should invest in Westpoint-related entities .

And one of the reasons planners breached their duties was the influence of higher commissions for them rather than recommending the appropriate investment for the investor .

Westpoint highlighted the dangers of a commission-based payment system for financial planners .

They are the kinds of dangers that have prompted National Australia Bank 's financial planning businesses -- its in-house planning network , and Garvan -- to move to a fee-for-advice financial planning model rather than rely on commission-based payments .

But back to those investment groups that are still paying 10 per cent-plus commissions to financial planners .
The agri-business sector is ripe with tax deductibility as it offers various `` flavours '' of tax-effective schemes .

Investors put their money into anything from olive groves to eucalypt forests , and hope like hell the Australian Taxation Office does not rethink the product rulings the investments rely on for their tax-deductible status .

Across the sector , 10 per cent commissions for financial planners who `` sell '' the products are the norm rather than the exception .

In a small sample of product disclosure statements , Barossa Vines ' Project 2007 paid up to 10 per cent or $ 400 to planners for every $ 4000 invested .
Macquarie Group 's Almond Investment 2007 pays an upfront commission of up to 12 per cent .
In the 78-page product disclosure statement for the 2007-08 Timbercorp Timberlot Project , commissions are described on page 66 as 5 per cent up front commission plus 5 per cent for the planning group 's costs in marketing the project .

Apart from commissions , there are other signs of the potential influence agribusiness schemes are exerting on financial planners .

This is demonstrated by the sponsorship dollars gained by Professional Investment Services , the country 's biggest network of financial planners , with more than 1400 licensed financial planners .

PIS , which is bigger than AMP 's financial planning business , held a conference in Las Vegas attended by 720 planners .
PIS 's register of alternative remuneration , which records `` soft dollar '' commissions from various fund managers , shows it raised $ 547,500 in sponsorships from a broad range of 43 different fund managers .

Within the total sponsorship , about $ 110,000 was provided by eight different agribusiness scheme promoters .

They are hardly household names , and include FEA Plantations , Barossa Vines , Brooklyn Park Organic Olive Grove , Almond Investors and Willmott Forests .

In other words , 20 c in every $ 1 of conference sponsorship was received from agribusiness promoters .
On any measure a 20 per cent level of agribusiness sponsorship is wildly disproportionate to the importance of agribusiness as an investment class .

An estimated $ 7 billion has been invested in agri-business schemes within the past seven years .
This figure represents 0.6 per cent of the $ 1.14 trillion now invested in the ASX 200 .

The high level of sponsorship from agribusiness promoters is partly explained by PIS 's roots among accountants dealing with clients ' tax issues .
But PIS has no fixed position on whether individual planners should take the full 10 per cent for selling these products .

It is too easy to get to a picture of big commissions , cosy sponsorships and real potential for influence .
One question is : why do planner groups let themselves and their planners get into this situation ?
Well , some do n't .
A Melbourne planner , National Financial Solutions , also pays back to investors up front commissions of up to 8 per cent of the investment , and takes a much smaller fee up front .

OK , so financial planners need to be paid .
But a 10 per cent commission on any investment ?
Give me a break .

Planning groups and planners that recognise and attempt to address the clear conflicts from higher-commission products are a step ahead of the game .

The ones that do n't are on a slippery slope that ends in a breach of the duty they owe to their investor clients .
