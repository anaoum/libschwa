<p class="MsoNormal">Following Ellie’s "ridiculous" win in the immunity challenge last night, the six non-bedroom-bound <em>MasterChef </em>contestants take to Times Square for a spot of looking like a rube ... or as Alana tells us to “soak it all in”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to really emphasise the wide-eyed tourist the narration duties are passed to Ellie. Quick cuts of time-lapse footage and lots of crash zooms convince us that this really is crazy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie tells us: “It’s just crazy! There are people from all walks of life ... tourists, sailors, taxi drivers”. In the background Billy can be seen jumping into one of the cabs that those drivers have abandoned, high-tailing it to the airport. I guess the prospect of a week locked in a room with Sun will do that to ya.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then the big screen – brought to you by two very prominent sponsor names – on Times Square fills with a pair of familiar faces. Kate wins the group’s game of I-Spy by pointing out that it’s “MattmoranandGeorge”. It’s nice to see they’re still using surnames to distinguish the Matts. Not tall-baldy and cravat, or bow tie and hideously-ugly-blue-lapelled-dinner-suit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MattmoranandGeorge start talking to Times Square, telling the group to listen up as Gary has an important announcement. And by announcement they mean cliché.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“This is New York and New York never sleeps ... and tonight the six of you won’t either” says 60-foot neon Gary. Ellie, Dani and Michael all take a small step towards Hayden. Gary then explains they will be challenging all night to prepare a three course meal for mystery guests.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“The next task is to select your co-worker. Look to your right, that’s who you’re cooking with.” Ellie hugs the New York police officer standing next to her and asks if he has immunity too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Kate is on Michael’s right and doesn’t get away in time so she explains to us that she thinks they’ll work well together. With a few more practices she might even sound convincing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">George tells Times Square that each pair is responsible for one course, and contestants won’t be cooking with “one of your creations” and Dr Frankenstein slinks away with monster in tow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No they’ll be stealing their dishes from three of New York’s best Michelin starred chefs. To find out who, they’ll have to follow the clues. “The information you seek is constantly on the move.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We cut to three out of work actors walking around Times Square wearing sandwich boards. Michael tells us that everything in Times Square is on the move so this won’t be easy as a skyscraper wanders past.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Gary tells us the name of the restaurant where we’ll be cooking and where we’ll dine – the Four Seasons – and to remember it. Ellie giggles. Then George starts of a countdown clock on the Times Square billboard and the six scatter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dani and Hayden start playing word games: “taxis move” says Hayden. Dani starts asking strangers. Ellie starts moving hoping that means that the clue will be on her, Alana reminds her to “still look, still look”. Michael suggest to Kate that “those guys on the bikes” (or rickshaws) might be clues. The teams are officially clueless.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then Dani sees a lady with a sandwich board and they’re off to wd-50 to find the recipe for the entree on the Lower East Side, so they hop in a cab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate dash to a second clue and are repelled, Kate by the prospect of having to cook steak frites for the main, Michael by the green apron the board-walker is holding out as he is really more of a winter palate. They too grab a taxi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie asks a sailor and a rickshaw rider if they have a message for her. Alana catches up though so the sailor looks a bit abashed about the clue he was about to give Ellie. Then Alana finds the final walking clue and discovers they are off to Tribeca to make dessert. But where is Tribeca? Ellie chooses this moment to stop asking taxi drivers questions, Alana takes up the mantle though yelling to Times Square “is anyone a local New Yorker”. The biggest tourist destination in the world stares blankly back at her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The clock tells us there is only 3 hours and 15 minutes remaining as the pair find a pair of ‘locals’ who respond to Alana’s question “Can we use the subway?” with the logic of an eight year old. “You may of course use the subway” and points her in the direction of the One Train. Silly Alana, you always follow up with “SHOULD I use the subway?” to out-logic that particular pedantic quip.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dani and Hayden in their cab are worried about the twenty minute ride their cab driver predicts. Dani promises to give him a tip if he can get there in 10. The driver promises to lock the doors and drive extra slow if she doesn’t give him a tip. Hayden’s thinking about that funny Pizza Hut commercial ... “be good to ya mum”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate find David Chang’s restaurant Ma Peche. They’ve been told to go in by the service entrance. Kate is upset about the rabbit warren they’ve entered. Michael is polishing off a small bottle with DRINK ME written on it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They finally get to the restaurant and get told to wait for ten minutes as apparently the Michelin-starred chef has more important things to do. Kate and Michael are stunned. How could anyone be more imp - we cut to Hayden and Dani who have just pulled up at wd-50 only to find that Wiley the chef they’re looking for is sick. Dani smiles and nods. He’s dying of an unknown virus. Hayden smiles and nods. John, the chef-cuisine , is so impressed with their sympathy in the face of illness that he stops what he’s doing to look after them... just as soon as we watch a pre-edited intro video. It’s lucky the show had that, what with Wiley’s unexpected illness and all. They are going to make everything bagel ice cream with trout threads. John gives them the recipe, the ingredients and kicks out the insensitive bastards.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie and Alana are sitting on the subway. A kindly New Yorker points out the train doesn’t go where they want to go. Ellie listens. Another explains to Ellie that the end of the world is nigh, so she relaxes as that means she won’t have to finish the challenge. Ellie asks if the locals are going her way and says she’ll follow them. The subway car empties as everyone decides these patsies in the yellow aprons are too good a target to pass up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate finally get David Chang’s attention and decide not to berate him for being so rude. They’re making Steak Frites with the fries made from rice and a side of asparagus and crab. He explains the dish, including the rice-fries, hands them the recipe with all the ingredients – including rice - and lets them try his version. Michael admires that the chips are made of rice. Kate tries the chip and there’s something wrong:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Okaaaay, so the chips are made of rice! I probably should have guessed that”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Which seems a little harsh, as there hadn’t been any clues up til then.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They’re on the road. Dani and Hayden are on the road. They’re all heading to Four Seasons, East 52<sup>nd</sup> Street. The driver notes that there’s a couple of them, so they suggest going to the one on East 52<sup>nd</sup> because “that’s what we were told”. Sheesh, as if anyone could forget that, Gary told them to remember it. Can you imagine ANYONE who would do that?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie and Alana are running like “Olympic sprinters” once they get off the subway. That would be Olympic muppet sprinters I take it, given the flailing arms. They arrive at “some random corner on some random street” as the inhospitable subway system neglects to deliver them door-to-door. They find the street but can’t find number 239. If only the numbers were in some sort of order. They ask two passersby where 239 is and the point it out, right there between 237 and 241. Honestly, only in America!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They charge in to the kitchen after attempting to enter a storage cupboard, and Ellie doesn’t think that anyone gets to do this. No one without a camera crew and a producer that is. Ellie starts begging Chef Paul <span> </span>for his recipe for Gold Bar dessert. Ellie says she’s scared of the dish. Given their blind meander through the streets of New York, it makes perfect sense that this is the first thing she’d be frightened of.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back in the kitchen Hayden is shocked they were back first and explains that the trout has to be cooked four ways, it’s tricky and takes a long time. Cured, poached, fried up and then smoked, it has to be done just right - so he’s sent Dani to count the cutlery and do some of the vital recapping of plot to camera. George wishes him luck and sets off to find Dani.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie and Alana are confident in their cab. They’ve already assigned their roles. Their current role is to be stuck in traffic. Finally they get to the Four Seasons. The <em>other</em> Four Seasons. The doorman refuses to let the two lunatics in yellow aprons in, presumably because he’s not a Michelin starred chef as they’ve been admitting lunatics all over the city. He suggests they go to the Four Seasons on <em>EAST</em> 52<sup>nd</sup> street. Honestly, who could have seen that coming?!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dani stands next to the automatic gelato maker explaining how hard she’s working. Michael explains that their chef “hammered into them” how important being organised was, but Michael explains that he’s too busy getting ready to be organised.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ellie and Alana run in and try to get going, so Gary stops them both to demand “where have you been?” Alana cooks, Ellie explains, Gary says that they’re on detention and to see the headmaster after class.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael has had another moment of inspiration. The recipe calls for the carrots to be peeled. He’s not going to. He wants to work on his crab. Kate wants him to work on his sauce. Thank goodness he didn’t spend time getting organised.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hayden is stirring his trout. Dani is stirring the other contestants, because she has nothing to do. Then the words that Australia has been waiting for, Dani tells us point blank “there isn’t an awful lot that I can do”. No one in the kitchen blinks at this Earth-shattering revelation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Kate is worried about hers and Michael’s process -to-time ratio. Matt Moran is worried about it too and tells them to make sure the steak and frites components of their Steak Frites are ready. Michael is worried about the crabs... so he’s ducked down the pharmacy and that’s just not helping.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hayden is smoking the trout. Dani is floating around trying to think up a witty play on words about smoking the trout. As this process only takes ten minutes though, she’s going to need it all. Hayden stops the smoking after five minutes. Dani is mortified, she hasn’t made a single pun. Hayden says the fish tastes right though which is more important. Dani is worried he’s blown it – oh wait there’s her pun, at least it would have been had she made it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The three pairs are plating up. Michael wants to do David Chang’s dish justice, so he’s sentenced himself to 300 hours of community service, as he’s left out the crab. Ellie and Alana plate up their chocolate gold bar with “real gold leaf”. Hayden thinks he and Dani have done enough to win. Kate says the absence of the crab from their dish is glaringly obvious, so Michael erases the chalk outline of a crab that he’s drawn on every plate. He has to rethink how to do justice to the crab that just made the ultimate sacrifice for nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The chefs come out to meet their guests. It turns out the judging panel consists of Julian Niccolini from the Four Seasons plus John from wd-50, David from Ma Peche and Paul from Corton, the three chefs who gave them the recipes. Hayden looks nervous, he’s not sure if he can smoke trout as well as John – see Dani, it’s just not that hard!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hayden and Dani present their entree to the panel of eight. George asks John if he’s smiling. It’s actually impressive that a man who can’t see the expression on the face of a chef sitting less than a metre away has survived to this age what with all the sharp objects and flames. John nods, then realises this won’t help, so explains that the bagel ice cream is perfect, but the smoked trout tastes like dried fish .See, it’s the subtle language of cooking that makes all the difference .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate serve up and worry that everyone but George will instantly see the absent crab. David is impressed that these two rank amateurs have achieved what they have. He says the flavours are all there. George is just thrilled that the steak isn’t overcooked, setting the bar considerably lower than the ‘perfectly cooked four ways’ Hayden and Dani had to overcome. Matt Moran asks if anyone missed the crab on the asparagus. David shakes his head. George stares expectantly at him waiting for an answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alana and Ellie break the awkward tension with their desserts. Paul thinks they did a “bloody good job”. Julian is “totally impressed”. Paul says they’re 85% there. George is impressed that they’ve gotten “anything up”, lowering that benchmark once more. He explains he’s just happy to “see this on a plate” and his joy is explained, his eyesight has returned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pairs return to the toom to have their rewards explained – a meal and master class with Daniel Boulud – and the cost of failure – a cook-off with Billy and Sun. This is the cue for a glimpse of Billy and Sun sitting in their hotel room. Billy is sitting reading a magazine; Sun is facing away from Billy staring in the mirror sipping on a takeaway coffee. The tension is so thick you could cut away from it with a very rapid editing decision.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For Dani and Hayden, the ice cream flavour is perfect, but the soy and the mirin were missing from the trout thread. Hayden explains that he was told to be light on the soy and mirin, so he was light on them. But as it’s a dish with two heroes, he feels his dish has a protagonist based problem.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate are morose, they have the nailed the hero in their dish, but that was actually the job of its nemesis, crab man, so they feel their comic franchise is in danger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Preston was just pleased to see Ellie and Alana’s smiley faces as they wheeled their desserts out. Immediately casting the girls as damsels in distress, Alana takes up the theme by pointing out that they are just “two little amateur chefs from Brisbane”. George is so impressed that they go 85% of the way there. He mentions the problems with the dish but Gary can’t wait to cut him off to say there has been only one stand out winner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That is of course the team utterly lacking in heroes, Team Dessert. Alana is so happy she sings. Ellie says there’s something in the water here that agrees with her. Isn’t that the alligators people flushed down the toilet? Gary says the eight men around the table all agreed that the girls and their dessert really stood out, and not just because it was chocolate. What more can you ask for? Your dessert is so good it’s not just chocolate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael and Kate are sure they are the team who came last. What with the missing ingredient that seems reasonable. Preston disagrees though. Michael looks distraught. Perhaps Katherine Feeney is right and he is worried more for Hayden than for himself. Kate is relieved. Hayden looks unimpressed. Dani is frustrated but realises that at this point of the competition it comes down to slight things. Things like missing ingredients and components (heroes if you will) of the dish that are too thick. Oh wait, that was the other teams.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">George explains that if it was just down to their performance in the kitchen they would have won by a landslide, but after reading the comments sections of our recaps, the producers feel they have to put Dani into the elimination so we have more material to work with. Moran says they don’t need to look devastated as they can redefine themselves tomorrow. Hayden starts now by redefining himself as the sort of person who talks about himself in the third person “this isn’t the end of Hayden, no way”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tomorrow the not-so-fab-four head to Harlem to cook soul food. Suddenly I try to remember if Sun actually had a reflection when she was looking in the mirror. Does she have a soul for soul food?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I guess we’ll find out.</p>
