LAWYERS for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ended their courtroom assault on One.Tel's founder Jodee Rich yesterday by laying the groundwork for a submission that his evidence should not be believed.<p />ASIC's barrister, Rob Macfarlan, QC, wrapped up his 19th day grilling Mr Rich by suggesting that "during the cross-examination you have not attempted to answer my questions fairly and frankly, have you?"<p />"Yes, I have," Mr Rich replied.<p />"And when you were at One.Tel you didn't attempt to deal with the board fairly and frankly, did you?"<p />"I disagree with that statement," Mr Rich said.<p />Justice Robert Austin gave Mr Rich and his lawyers a day's adjournment today to discuss how his re-examination should proceed and whether the defence would call any other witnesses.<p />Mr Rich's barrister, David Williams, SC, told the court that he needed time to examine more than 40 summaries of aspects of One.Tel's finances prepared by ASIC and presented to Mr Rich while he was in the witness box.<p />ASIC alleges that, as managing director, Mr Rich failed to monitor the phone company's finances adequately and misled the board about its true position in the four months before its May 2001 collapse.<p />Under court rules, Mr Williams was unable to discuss the case with his client while he was under cross-examination.<p />Justice Austin overrode an objection by ASIC when granting the delay before re-examination. He said ASIC's point that such an adjournment was not usual practice "does not hold much water in this case".<p />"What's usual and what's not usual has often not held sway - and for good reason," the judge said.<p />The case, which opened in August 2004 with predictions that hearings would last for four months, has sat for 190 days, with interruptions for taking evidence in the United Kingdom and for appeals on procedural issues, including to the High Court.<p />Justice Austin is yet to rule on whether ASIC can present a formal case in reply following Mr Rich's decision to exercise his right to present a formal defence.<p />The court is also waiting to hear whether the co-defendant, One.Tel's former finance director Mark Silbermann, will choose to give evidence.<p />If he does, and if ASIC presents a case in reply, the rest of the year will be taken up with a timetable for the exchange of written closing submissions. Oral submissions would then begin when the court resumes on January 29 next year.
