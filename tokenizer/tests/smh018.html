RICKY PONTING was justifiably infuriated as the Ashes were engulfed by another catching controversy on Sunday, when inconsistent umpiring cost the Australians the wicket of Phillip Hughes as their long chase began beneath cloudy skies at Lord's.<p />Umpire Rudi Koertzen was again in the hot seat with colleague Billy Doctrove, and Ponting was at the non-striker's end when Hughes edged to first slip, where England captain Andrew Strauss claimed a low, scooping catch.<p />Ponting told Hughes to stand his ground, and Koertzen consulted square leg umpire Doctrove before sending Hughes on his way for 17 without referring it to the third umpire. Only a day earlier, Ponting had confronted Koertzen after Ravi Bopara was given not out on the strength of inconclusive video evidence after Nathan Hauritz was convinced he took a clean catch at mid-on.<p />This time the replays appeared to show the ball touching the ground as Strauss's fingers curled around it, and Ponting was entitled to feel aggrieved Koertzen did not refer it. He could not suppress his frustration, and appeared to query the South African umpire as Hughes walked back to the dressing room with the Australians in trouble at 2-34, only 45 minutes into their monumental quest to save the Test.<p />Ponting's day got worse when he attempted a cut shot to Stuart Broad and was bowled for 38 just after lunch. His mood would not have improved when he watched from the dressing room as Mike Hussey was given out caught at slip off the off spin of Graeme Swann, and the Hot Spot technology showed he hit the ground with his bat rather than the ball. It meant three of Australia's first four wickets fell in contentious circumstances, and Australia slumped to 4-120.<p />England declared overnight with a lead of 521, more runs than have ever been scored in a fourth-innings chase to win a Test. Australia must bat for two days to save it. The touring side had already suffered a serious setback when the catching controversy broke out, Simon Katich playing a rare loose shot to Andrew Flintoff.<p />Katich, the backbone of Australia's batting since returning to the team a year ago, sliced a catch to Kevin Pietersen at gully for six. To rub salt into the tourists' wounds, the replays suggested Flintoff had overstepped but the umpire, Koertzen again, did not signal a no-ball.<p />Play started 15 minutes late because of morning showers and the English made an aggressive start with the words of Matt Prior, England's top-scorer with 61 in 42 balls against a ragged Australian attack on Saturday evening, ringing in their ears.<p />"You talk about putting your foot on someone's throat and not letting go, and I think we have done that very, very well," he said. "They threw punches back like any Australian team does but we managed to cushion those blows and then come back even harder."<p />Hughes swayed out of the way of a couple of short balls, and Flintoff walked up the pitch and gave the 20-year-old Australian an intimidatory glare at the end of his first over. Hughes has scores of 36, four and 17 in his first three Ashes innings and had started to assert himself by carving a couple of boundaries in his decisive way.<p />Much rested on Ponting, who had a flinty look in his eye as he made his mark with a crisp off drive and a rocking pull shot before Jimmy Anderson got a ball to spit up off the pitch and strike him on the fingers. The Tasmanian merely took a few moments for the pain to subside before resuming. He started the innings needing 63 runs to pass Allan Border's Australian run-scoring record but his focus was on preserving Australia's proud record at Lord's.<p />His opposite number, Strauss, was criticised for not enforcing the follow-on with a lead of 210 on day three.
