<p>Thousands of volunteers have turned out today to help clean flood-hit suburbs, but their efforts are being hampered by traffic gridlock on the city's roads.</p>
<p>As anger mounts at so called "rubberneckers" sightseeing in worst-hit suburbs, there are reports of long delays across the road network, despite the reopening of several major arterials.</p>

<p>The Australian Traffic Network has reported access to the suburbs of  Fairfield and Yeronga has been closed until further notice after thousands  of motorists and volunteers converged on the area.</p>
<p>"There's just too many people in the area," Traffic reporter Jay Lane said.</p>
<p>This morning, 7000 volunteers presented at <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/how-to-help-volunteers-in-flood-of-support-20110113-19p6n.html"><strong>four Brisbane City Council volunteer registration centres</strong></a>, before being dispatched on buses to flood-damaged areas.</p>
<p>The council had expected to register 6000 volunteers today, but by early this afternoon the number had risen to 11,500. The massive response caused police to warn of traffic bottlenecks around the registration centres.<br /><br />Registrations for today have closed and will reopen tomorrow from 7am.</p>
<p>This morning, several busloads of volunteers on four-hour shifts were seen stuck in horrendous traffic in Brisbane's west.</p>
<p>There were extensive delays along Milton Road, Moggill Road, Sherwood Road and Oxley Road as residents try to reach home to help with the clean up effort.</p>
<p>Traffic is now flowing freely along the Centenary Highway, Ipswich Motorway and Pacific Motorway which all experienced heavy congestion after reopening for the first time since the floods this morning.</p>
<p>Mr Lane said this morning it had taken one motorist 90 minutes to travel the length of the Centenary Highway, while a traffic accident on the Pacific Motorway through Macgregor slowed traffic to a crawl.</p>
<p>One brisbanetimes.com.au reporter spent two hours crawling from the Riverside Expressway to Taringa, along Coronation Drive and Moggill Road.</p>
<p>Brisbane District Disaster Co-ordinator Assistant Commissioner Peter Martin said motorists should expect traffic congestion and delays around <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/how-to-help-volunteers-in-flood-of-support-20110113-19p6n.html"><strong>council's four volunteer hubs</strong></a>, in Boondall, Mt Coot-tha, MacGregor, Doomben.</p>
<p>He called on motorists to be patient, tolerant and drive to road conditions.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on attending a volunteer hub, think about carpooling or organising a lift and pick-up rather than driving in.  We expect to see a lot of activity at these centres over the coming days,” he said.</p>
<p>“And please if you are not directly contributing to the clean-up effort we ask that you stay away from flood affected areas.  Don’t unnecessarily contribute to the traffic congestion; help your community by staying home.”</p>
<p>Rosalie resident Neil Aveling, whose home was one of the few in the suburb to escape flooding, said he had seen a steady stream  of rubberneckers with cameras.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of traffic coming, up and down,” he said.</p>
<p>“People drive down and turn around, take photos and go.”</p>
<p>The practice attracted the ire of online readers, with commenters on brisbanetimes.com.au stories yesterday venting their fury.</p>
<p>“They should be ashamed of themselves,” commented one resident from flood-torn Paddington as <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/traffic-groans-as-roads-reopen-20110114-19qrl.html"><strong>reports of clogged roads</strong></a> emerge.</p>
<p>“They are just there for a good sticky beak at other people's misery,” ‘Boo’ said. “Do what the police said and *STAY AT HOME*(sic).”</p>
<p>RACQ spokeswoman Lynda Schekoske said it was “hard to believe the  lack of common sense and courtesy for fellow citizens” being shown by  some members of the Brisbane public.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to be done, and people out rubbernecking and  sightseeing are really going to slow down that critical work,” Ms  Schekoske said.</p>
<p>“If you have a good reason to be out in your car, go about what you  are doing with sensitivity and respect for people who live in those  streets.</p>
<p>“The last thing they need is more damage being done because you’re driving up and down and not being sensitive about it.”</p>
<p>Ms Schekoske said Brisbane drivers should exercise caution and leave their car at home where possible.</p>
<p>“Unless you really need to be on the roads, don’t be.”</p>
<p>She also urged motorists not to speed through flooded streets in residential areas, saying the wash could cause further damage.</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner Martin police would be actively conducting patrols to assist with the flow of traffic during the recovery phase of the disaster.</p>
<p>“Please help us by obeying police direction on our roads.</p>
<p>“Don’t park illegally, don’t block road access, don’t try to access closed roads and please obey police direction and traffic diversions.”</p>
<p>Volunteers joined hundreds of Australian Defence Force (ADF)  personnel already on the ground in Brisbane. And another 250 or so  soldiers are expected to arrive in Ipswich today to help with the  clean-up.</p>
<p>The council has directed large-bodied trucks dumping flood waste to go directly to the landfill site at 174 Gardner Road, Rochedale.</p>
<p>The landfill site is open from 6am to 9pm.</p>
