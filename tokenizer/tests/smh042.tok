Struggling clothing and handbag retailer OrotonGroup has hinted it could reconsider a bid from a private equity group or selling off parts of its business , one year after rejecting a takeover offer from Catalyst Investment Managers .

Oroton , whose share price hit a five-year low last month after it issued a profit downgrade , announced yesterday it would conduct a strategic review that would `` examine all the strategic options available '' to the group .

The company said it had appointed the independent investment bank Carnegie Wylie to `` assess the strategic and financial impact of the various options and to advise on a course of action '' .

Oroton managing director Ross Lane declined to specify what options the company was looking at .
Mr Lane would only say the review would look at `` various paths the group can go down in attracting shareholder value '' .
He declined to rule out attracting an offer from a private equity group .

`` There 's a lot of possibilities and at this stage I 'm not prepared to discuss any of the individual possibilities , '' he said .

Mr Lane said the review was `` related to the value of the company and the value of the assets we have in the company '' .

Oroton shares rose 6 c to $ 1.29 yesterday but have fallen $ 2.01 from their 2003 high .

Mr Lane , whose family has a 53 per cent stake in the company , said he had no regrets rejecting the offer from Catalyst last year , which is believed to have been at double Oroton 's current price .

`` The offer at the time was n't acceptable and we do n't think our shareholders would have accepted it , '' Mr Lane said .
He said the bid was overly conditional yet still declined to say how much it was worth .
It is rumoured the bid was valued at around $ 2.50 a share .

The group 's troubles have largely stemmed from the Marcs retail chain it purchased for $ 22 million three years ago .

Oroton plans to relaunch the Marcs brand next month , which Mr Lane said would involve a `` new tone of voice '' .

He said the new Marcs would have lower price points and a `` colour palette more relevant to Australian consumers '' .
He conceded the recent colour range of purples offered in Marcs ' winter catalogues was `` not appropriate for men '' .

Last month , the company said its Polo and Morrissey brands also performed poorly .
