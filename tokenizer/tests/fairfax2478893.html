<p>Public outrage over the treatment of Australian cattle in Indonesian abattoirs has spilled into local sales of meat, with butchers reporting a drop in consumer demand after the exposure of animal cruelty.</p>
<p>The Australian Meat Industry Council, representing independent butchers who account for about half of all meat sales in the nation, reported a 10 to 15 per cent drop in sales since the ABC <em>Four Corners</em> program on cattle slaughtering in Indonesia aired at the start of last week.</p>
<p>"Seeing what was the appalling and abhorrent treatment of animals upsets people's values and makes them not want to eat meat," said AMIC spokesman Tom Maguire. "There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are turned away from the product, as well.</p>
<p>"What you saw on the program would not happen in an Australian abattoir," Mr Maguire said, referring to the ABC program that aired on Monday May 30. "The appalling cruelty that occurred is against Australian law."</p>
<p>Mr Maguire said Australian abattoirs have fully audited systems with animals stunned prior to slaughter.</p>
<p>The Gillard government late yesterday responded to public anger by announcing it would <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/live-cattle-ban-to-stay-20110607-1fr8b.html" target="_blank"><strong>ban all live cattle exports to Indonesia </strong></a>until appropriate animal welfare safeguards are in place.</p>
<p>Indications of an economic fallout from the decision are appearing with major beef producer Australian Agricultural Company today entering a trading halt on the Australian stock exchange as the company examines the statement on the effect on it of the ban on live beef shipments to Indonesia.</p>
<p>"We're very supportive of what the federal government has done because it's allowing us to get around the table and hopefully restore some community confidence in the industry," said Mr Maguire.</p>
<p>Despite the reported fall in meat sales, major supermarkets chain Woolworths said it had seen no difference in meat demand since the revelations were made public.</p>
<p>"It appears Australian consumers have made the distinction between that which is exported to Indonesia and that which is completely home grown," said spokesman Benedict Brook.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers-owned Coles was not immediately available for comment.</p>
