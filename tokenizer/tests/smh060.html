The Office <p />UK-TV, 8.30pm <p />Before the wry smiles, this ground-breaking series makes us cringe for David Brent, London regional manager of paper merchant Wernham Hogg. Marvellously played by his creator, Ricky Gervais, Brent perpetrates a stream of unwittingly cruel and sexist jokes, many of them directed at his receptionist Dawn (Lucy Davis). This pathetic jokemeister seeks popularity by hovering over his staff, so the show makes welcome escapes into a corner where Gareth, the office creep (Mackenzie Crook), is at loggerheads with Tim (Martin Freeman).<p />Yours for a Song<p />Ovation, 7.30pm<p />Great songwriters of the old century? Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, certainly, but consider A Fine Romance, The Way You Look Tonight, Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall and In a Little Spanish Town. All standards and all written by women. A delightful, surprising documentary. <p />Everyone's a Psychic<p />W, 7.30pm<p /> Lucy Cavendish has a happy, infectious way of persuading viewers to unleash and develop the psychic powers she is certain we all possess.
