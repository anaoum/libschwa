Devising the best way to spruik a business is half the battle these days, as Nina Hendy reports. <p />As the list of marketing options grows to include social networking, email marketing and whisper campaigns, small- and medium-size businesses must have a solid marketing strategy.<p />But the truth is that more than half of them in Australia don't bother. A recent survey by business-management company Access Management Corporation found 58.9 per cent of small-business owners don't prepare an annual marketing strategy or attempt to identify the benefit and cost of marketing. This could be why the failure rate of small businesses is so high in the first year.<p />The director of Marketing Elements, Cecelia Haddad, is not surprised by the research.<p />"A lot of businesses don't put much thought into a marketing plan and as a result, it's often done ad hoc," she says. "Businesses need to realise that marketing isn't an expense but a legitimate business-building activity."<p />But a lot of small businesses don't know how to develop a marketing strategy.<p />Often they will try a marketing technique based on their own ideas or what may seem like a bargain only to realise it only reached a small percentage of their target market, by which time their budget is blown, she says.<p />A marketing plan should look at how a business will promote itself to its target audience, usually over a 12-month period.<p />Haddad says a marketing plan should include a detailed budget and examine the best ways to promote the business.<p />You want [it] to take in analysis of your competitors and to have specific goals," she says. "It also needs to break down how much you've set aside for marketing, how you're going to spend it, look at who your target audience is and how you tackle internal and external communications.<p />A marketing plan for a small business might be only a few pages long but larger businesses often require a more-detailed plan.<p />The plan needs to be revisited monthly  or, at the very least, quarterly, Haddad says.<p />Business owners can write their own plan or hire an expert, which would cost $1000 to $7000, depending on the size of the business and who is used.<p />Zadro Communications recently created Comm*Bat, which helps businesses determine marketing priorities for 12 months.<p />Managing director Felicity Zadro says small to medium businesses often find marketing plans intimidating and expensive.<p />We found that companies are either too busy to stop and write a marketing strategy or simply don't place enough value on having a plan in place," she says.<p />The founder of storage business Fiona Kate, Fiona Chandler, changes her marketing strategy each year.<p />At first it was geared toward PR but we've grown our marketing as we can afford to and now also include writing articles about storage and have created a blog, Chandler says.
