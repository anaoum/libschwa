Winners

All Blacks .
The weather , according to a Westpac Stadium onlooker , was decidedly chully and the Wallabies defence choice , bro .
Yet despite Australia 's continued defiance throughout Saturday night 's Tri Nations opener , New Zealand controlled possession , field position and eventually the match to retain the Bledisloe Cup .
With ball in hand for around 80 per cent of the contest , the All Blacks shelved the attacking flair that dissolved England last month and , instead , wore down the Australians through sheer persistence and pressure in the soggy conditions .
And after the match , the New Zealanders were buoyant upon learning of another pleasing outcome -- hooker Keven Mealamu escaped suspension for brawling with a battered , bruised and bloody Brendan Cannon .
The Australian hooker , meanwhile , was banned for two matches for his part in the altercation .
`` Thet calls for sux peck of DB butter from the chully bun , '' the onlooker said .
( We assume he 's happy with the outcome . )

Hazem El Masri .
A personal hat-trick of tries is invariably a cause for celebration -- but never more so than when the individual concerned is involved in contract negotiations .
El Masri 's sublime performance against the Sharks yesterday , during which he scored 20 points and led the Bulldogs to a hard-fought victory , certainly wo n't hurt his chances of landing a pay rise beyond this season .
Already courted by the French rugby union , the burly Bulldogs winger again showcased his attacking prowess , crossing for a pair of first-half tries , then scoring a crucial four-pointer after the break .
Braith Anasta , reportedly considering a switch to rugby union after next season , scored two tries in the same match .

Losers

Danny Williams .
`` Fairytale finishes '' to careers have been the talk of this rugby league season , most notably in the case of Brad Fittler .
Williams , on the other hand , is facing the most acrimonious exit imaginable -- sent from the field for king-hitting Tigers forward Mark O'Neill and facing a suspension in excess of 12 weeks .
Off contract at the end of the season , the 30-year-old Williams 's only hope of extending his career could be a bizarre defence strategy when he fronts the judiciary -- claiming to have no recollection of the incident because O'Neill had collected him in a high tackle the previous play .
But the veteran Storm forward did admit to feelings of remorse for his actions , yesterday penning a letter of apology to O'Neill , who has subsequently been cleared of a fractured cheekbone .
`` It was stupid , dumb and cost us the game , '' said Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy , commenting on Williams 's sucker punch .

Sydney Swans .
The rollercoaster continues .
After pressing Geelong to the wire throughout yesterday 's clash at Skilled Stadium -- only to fall agonisingly short -- Sydney fell to seventh place on the AFL ladder and face a trying fortnight ahead .
With an away match against sixth-placed Fremantle , then a home clash with defending premiers Brisbane looming , the Swans now face the most crucial phase of their season .
`` It was one of those days where every contest , every decision , every time a player got the ball , it was going to have a huge bearing on the outcome , '' Swans coach Paul Roos said of the tense match against the Cats .

Odd Spot

Steroids in sport ?
That 's expected .
Steroids in cheerleading ?
That 's another matter .
According to a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette , two Air Force Academy footballers and one male cheerleader have been charged with steroid violations and subsequently court-martialled .
Jonathan Belkowitz , the cheerleader in question , was charged with making a false statement , wrongful use , importation , introduction and distribution of steroids .
He could be confined for 55 years , the Gazette reported , as well as facing forfeiture of pay and dismissal from the academy .
