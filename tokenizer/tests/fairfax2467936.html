<p>If getting out of bed this morning was a struggle, tomorrow could be a real test, with the mercury set to fall to single digits.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Brisbane had a low of 10.3 degrees at 6.35am in the city.</p>
<p>But Weatherzone meteorologist Brett Dutschke said tomorrow morning was likely to be around the 9-degree mark.</p>
<p>"If 9 degrees does turn out to be the minimum, it's seven years since it's been this cold this early in the year," he said.</p>
<p>"And if it actually gets below 9 degrees, it's at least a decade since it would have done so this early in the year."</p>
<p>Mr Dutschke said Friday morning was likely to be colder again, with Brisbane's mild winter just weeks away.</p>
<p>"It's still pretty early in the month, and May's a transition month where it cools down quite a bit, but this weather system at the moment is very unusual for this time of year," he said.</p>
<p>"It's highly likely to be seven years since it's been this cold this early in the year, so it's quite a contrast since the recent nights.</p>
<p>"We had 16 degrees Sunday night/Monday morning, so it's a big change in only a few days."</p>
<p>A daytime maximum of 22 degrees is expected tomorrow, but Mr Dutschke said it would feel like the coldest day of the year so far.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow might feel like the coldest day this year, because it'll be the windiest day of the week," he said.</p>
<p>"Only a few days ago, the maximum was 18.9 and it's definitely going to be a low-20s day, but it'll feel colder because of that wind.</p>
<p>"There'll be plenty of sunshine, but that wind chill is going to be felt by a lot of people."</p>
<p>At this stage, the Bureau of Meteorology expects minimum temperatures to rise after Friday, with forecasts not dropping below double digits after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Maximums are expected to stay around the 22-23 degree mark for the next week.</p>
