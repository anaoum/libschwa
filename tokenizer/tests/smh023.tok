If having to pay high petrol prices is not enough , a survey shows Sydney CBD car parking spaces continue to rank among the most expensive in the world .

Although owning a car space is considered a positive for building landlords , more office workers are catching the bus , which has pushed the price of the spaces even higher .

Sydney 's CBD has become the most expensive city in the Asia-Pacific region and the third most expensive in the world for monthly parking rates , with a median unreserved rate of $US 774.76 ( $ 792 ) .

The main car parking areas in Sydney are owned by corporate trusts .
In May Mariner Financial withdrew the Sydney Opera House car park from sale .
It had been expected to fetch $ 120 million .

At the same time management of the Domain car park near the Royal Botanic Gardens was taken from the City of Sydney Council by Challenger Diversified Property Group .

Colliers International 's 2008 Global CBD Parking Rates Survey was conducted last month and covered a broad selection of 138 cities across North America , Europe , Asia and Latin America .

While the results represent an increase from last year 's survey , in which Sydney was ranked fourth on the global rankings with a rate of $US 668 , commuters can take some relief that they are still a long way behind London , which took out the two top spots .

Not surprisingly , the most expensive monthly median rate was recorded in London city at $US 1166.87 , followed by London 's west end at $US 1135.76 .

This compared with Midtown , New York , where the median rate was $US 585 , and central Tokyo , where it was $US 552 .
Coming in between Sydney and Brisbane was Hong Kong , where the median rate was $US 742.40 .

Felice Spark , the state director of commercial research for Colliers International , said the results for monthly parking rates showed a clear correlation between plummeting office vacancies and car parking costs .

`` Coupled with this , parking stock within CBDs across the country is increasingly tight , '' she said .

`` This dearth of parking and accompanying rise in cost , coupled with skyrocketing petrol prices -- all in the face of a stagnating economy -- exacerbates the everyday headaches faced by commuters nationwide . ''
