Michael Diamond has fished himself out of ``the hard times&quot; and is
setting out on the road to Athens, and Dawn Fraser's record, writes Jessica
Halloran.
<p>Laughter rolls out of Johnny Boxer's mouth as he anticipates the day to come
on his mate Michael Diamond's boat, Pump Action. He says he's going to jump off
and go swimming starkers in Botany Bay.
<p>``It's hot, hey, got a T-shirt for me to wear, Dicky Knee?&quot; says Boxer, beer
 and fag seemingly stapled to his tattooed left hand.
<p>Dicky Knee  that's Diamond  shakes his head with a knowing smile and chuckles
 as he throws Boxer a daisy-yellow T-shirt.
<p>Diamond, who has already won two Olympic gold medals but wants a third to
equal ``Dawn's record&quot; and honour his late father, Constantine, cranks up the
booming engines of his 40 footer, diesel clouds puffing into the sunshine.
<p>``Smokin',&quot; barks Boxer.
<p>There are fewer than 100 days to go before the Games begin in the heat of
Athens. It's ``incredible&quot; that these Games are so close says Diamond,
remembering the Sydney Olympics as though they were yesterday.
<p>``All of a sudden, it's 2004.&quot;
<p>Diamond, slick mirrored glass shielding his eyes, loads beer onto the boat.
The Sutherland Shire waters are glassy and it's a lovely autumn day for boating,
 drinking and fishing. Ah, the life of a shooter.
<p>``Dicky Knee? He's elated, the guy couldn't be happier, everything is behind
him and he's got one road in front of him,&quot; Boxer says, then pauses for effect.
 ``. . . the road to Athens.&quot;
<p>The stereo has ``a shitload of music&quot; on it and the tunes start pumping on
Pump Action. Acts such as Usher and Jamelia blare out, the lyrics bursting out
of the speakers, ``F--- you, you bitch, I don't want you back&quot;, as the boat
moves out to the bay.
<p>The movie Anger Management is playing on the boat's DVD. No one on board has
any pending appointments  John the ``boat maintainer&quot;, Diamond's friends Ben
and Robbie, his nephew Matthew and, of course, Boxer, the former Kings Cross
bouncer who stars as Bobo in Fat Pizza. They all twist the tops off their
stubbies as Pump Action moves under the Captain Cook bridge.
<p>``This is great, this is why life is great, brother,&quot; Diamond says.
<p>Men are ``brothers&quot;. Women? Usually ``chicken&quot; or ``darl&quot;.
<p>Diamond sips his beer. His mobile phone ``cock-a-doodle-dos&quot;, as it does
throughout the day. He has ``a lot of friends&quot;.
<p>Fishing rods and nets are crammed into every nook of the galley and deck, and
 someone remarks that it's a good day to drop a line. Later, a school of
mackerel ruffles the sea surface and the boys get their fishing rods out,
snaring three. Diamond loves fishing, says it's helped him through the ``hard
times&quot;.
<p>``I do a lot of deep-sea fishing,&quot; he says. ``That's nearly every weekend
when the season's on. That's probably the most relaxing thing. On the boat, on
the water, you feel like you are leaving everything behind on land. Including
some of your problems to do with sport and stuff and all that sort of thing that
 you completely forget about.&quot;
<p>When he says ``hard times&quot;, he means the court case involving his former
partner, Tracey Kennedy . He was charged with assault after an incident in a
Queanbeyan bowling club car park following an 80th birthday party. Kennedy
alleged Diamond slapped and punched her and pulled her hair. He told the court
he was kicked in the testicles by Kennedy. He told her it was just a ``pussy
kick&quot; and she then ran her fingernails across his eyes.
<p>He was found not guilty.
<p> While the assault charge was being heard he had his gun licence suspended
and missed a crucial qualifying event for the Olympic trap shooting team. The
Australian Shooting Association subsequently granted Diamond a shoot-off against
 Nathan Cassells for a spot on the Olympic team. Diamond won but Cassells then
appealed against his Olympic selection, and a hearing will be held at the Court
of Arbitration for Sport on Tuesday to decide who competes in Athens.
<p>Diamond now says he felt betrayed by Kennedy  and that changed his view on
life.
<p>``The hard times we've gone through really weren't called for,&quot; he says.
``Relationships shouldn't be that hard, at all. But there are people out there
that will do it, and that's unfortunate. That's life.&quot;
<p>When Boxer speaks about the uneasy few months, he talks of Diamond's
coolness, pronounced ``kewelness&quot;, under ``media, personal, relationship&quot;
pressure.
<p>``He had the whole world lookin' at him!&quot; Boxer says. ``The guy came out
smelling like a rose.&quot;
<p>Diamond points the boat in the direction of Sylvania Waters, the ``extreme
waterfront&quot;, to a house that is obscured, where he grew up as a kid.
<p>``I want to try and buy it back one day,&quot; he says. ``In 1972, my dad bought
the land for 40,000 and built the house for 20,000. It's now worth 2.5
million.&quot;
<p>His father gave him an air rifle when he was six. So, just as Bradman used a
cricket stump and a golf ball against a corrugated iron water tank, Diamond shot
 at swinging cans hanging off coathangers on trees to perfect his hand-eye
co-ordination.
<p>This helped, but his father, his mentor, his coach, is the reason he is so
successful. Constantine died in May of 2000. Diamond speaks fondly of him and
his advice.
<p>``There could have been more than two or three thousand times in my career
when my dad was alive when I could have pulled the pin, because as a young man
all I wanted to do was nightclub,&quot; he says. ``He stopped me from doing that,
taught me discipline. I could have pulled the pin that many times because I
didn't want to be that dedicated.&quot;
<p>In Atlanta in 1996 his father called, calmed his son's nerves: ``Don't worry,
 son, it's natural to feel scared,&quot; Constantine said. ``You can do it, just
block that nervous side out.&quot;
<p>Diamond did and won his first gold. And if he wins his third, he'll dedicate
it to his father.
<p>``His most valuable words that he told ever me were, `Don't move your gun
before you see your target'. When you are ready to make a move on your target,
get it aggressively, don't be on the back foot, always lead with your front
foot.' They're probably the most valuable words that he said to me, and I hung
on to, right up until now, and I'll probably take it to the grave with me.
<p>``All I am going to do is take Dad's advice again, because that worked the
first time. First time is not different to the third time.&quot;
<p>The boat heads toward the third runway of Sydney Airport, jumbos are punching
 through the white-blue sky and the dolphins are playing in the shimmering
water.
<p>``I've never seen that before in my life,&quot; Diamond says. ``How unreal is
that?&quot;
<p>Diamond points out a spot where he goes scuba diving and snorkelling. This is
 when Boxer makes jokes about ``patting white pointers&quot;, taming them and
wrestling them, and Diamond doing the same.
<p>But there are no sharks, and, thank goodness, none of the ``60 foot&quot; waves
Diamond says the boat has pounded through before, with everyone on board signing
 crosses and crying ``Hail Marys&quot;.
<p>``No dramas on the Bahamas,&quot; Diamond says.
<p>His voicemail message is all reggae beats and an instruction to ``leave a
message, mon&quot;. It's this cruisy kind of coolness Diamond promotes about
himself. Perhaps it's his ``easygoing&quot; nature that keeps him poised under
pressure.
<p>So what does it take be the world's best?
<p>``I know I'm as good as the best. I've just got to follow the correct steps
and do everything right and I can beat him. I can be there,&quot; he says.
<p>``I am dealing with the pressure all the time. It seems to get harder as I
get older, pressure when you're shooting, when the heat's on, and you've got a
lot riding on your shoulders  the pressure is significant. It's very easy to be
distracted, that's where the biggest battle comes in . . . once you do let
distraction in, it's all over. And it doesn't take much.&quot;
<p>Diamond says he'd like to go to the next three Olympics, that there are no
use-by dates for shooters. He'd like to equal Fraser's record of winning three
golds in the same event at three Olympics.
<p>``Isn't she a wonderful figure?&quot; he says. ``Absolutely wonderful sporting
figure. To be even close to being able to match a record such as Dawn's. Even if
 I have won [only] two in a row, it's nice to have come second to her.&quot;
