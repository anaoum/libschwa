The partnership behind the Very Fast Train between Sydney and Canberra
yesterday welcomed the Premier's $600 million commitment to the project.
<p>The commitment calls for the State-owned Transgrid to help electrify the VFT
line, with the costs paid over 20 or 30 years. It also requires the co-operation
 of the Rail Access Corporation.
<p>A spokesman for SpeedRail, a partnership between Leighton Holdings and the
French-based Alstom, said : ``We are very heartened by this public declaration
by Mr Carr.&quot;
<p>Access to the city's rail system had been a potential sticking point, he
said.
<p> But Mr Carr repeated that there would be no money from the State Budget for
the $3 billion VFT project.
<p>He made it clear that NSW was leaving it to the Federal Government to take
the lead role in helping the VFT, which had always been predicated on the basis
of ``no net&quot; cost to the NSW Government.
<p>The Premier said:``We are prepared to offer assistance which is not budgetary
 assistance but incentives worth, I'm told, about $600 million that would
support the project.
<p>``This is a project of national significance and if there is to be a
government contribution, it should be from the Federal Government.&quot;
<p> NSW commitments to rail projects were already taken up with the Parramatta
to Chatswood link and upgrades on the Central Coast, the Hunter and Wollongong.
