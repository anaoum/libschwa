Western powers are refusing to intervene to halt spiralling violence in the Middle East despite a civilian death toll that has soared to 227 .

Israeli air attacks killed at least 70 people across Lebanon on Monday and yesterday , including about 50 civilians and 20 members of the Lebanese Army .

The dead included 10 members of one family , including several children , who were killed when Israeli aircraft shelled their car as it crossed a bridge in an attempt to escape south Lebanon .
Another family was wiped out when Israeli aircraft bombed their house .

Meanwhile , at least 100 missiles fired by Hezbollah into northern Israel struck areas as far south as Afula and injured 11 people in an apartment building in Haifa .

Of the Lebanese killed in Israeli air strikes and shelling since fighting broke out last Wednesday , only a handful are members of Hezbollah .
The militia group killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two more in a border raid that sparked the crisis , and Israel subsequently lost four naval personnel when a missile struck a vessel off Beirut .
Twelve Israeli civilians have been killed by long-range Hezbollah missiles .

At a meeting in Brussels on Monday , European Union foreign ministers called on Israel not to take `` disproportionate action '' in Lebanon , but removed explicit criticism from the text at the insistence of Germany and Britain .

The EU 's failure to take a stand on the violence came after the G8 summit in St Petersburg at the weekend , which did not call for a ceasefire but urged restraint from both sides .
The G8 declaration blamed the violence on `` extremist elements and those that support them '' -- a reference to Syria and Iran .

The Lebanese Prime Minister , Fouad Siniora , has repeatedly pleaded for a ceasefire to end the suffering caused by Israel 's targeting of civilian homes , vehicles and infrastructure , as well as its bombing and blockading of Lebanon 's airports , ports , roads and petrol stations .

Washington is opposed to any attempt to impose a ceasefire on Israel , which is determined to continue its attacks -- and perhaps invade by land as well if Hezbollah does not free its two Israeli prisoners .

Australia has strongly backed the US and Israeli line , with the Foreign Affairs Minister , Alexander Downer , refusing to be drawn on the scale of Lebanese civilian casualties and suffering .

`` It will simply be the end of the country [ Israel ] if they do n't go out there and aggressively defend themselves , '' he said in a radio interview yesterday .
`` The Israelis have made it pretty clear over the years they will aggressively defend themselves . ''

France , the closest Lebanon has to an ally , is calling for an immediate ceasefire and for Hezbollah to release its prisoners .
The appeal came yesterday from the French Prime Minister , Dominique de Villepin , on a visit to Lebanon -- the only high-level foreign official to visit the beleaguered country since the onslaught began .

The British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , has proposed sending a beefed-up international peace-keeping force to establish a buffer zone in southern Lebanon , but the proposal is widely seen as unrealistic .
Few Western armies are anxious to commit their troops to Lebanon in the light of the country 's recent history .

In a speech to the Knesset on Monday , the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , said operations against Lebanon would continue for as long as it took for Israel to achieve its goals .

Israeli newspapers yesterday quoted senior defence officials as saying they had a one- or two-week window in which to press home their operations , after which international pressure would build for a ceasefire to halt the killings .
