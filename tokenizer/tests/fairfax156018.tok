A friendly smile and a nice cuppa tea and all this military madness would be over in an instant , says Ted Ringrose .

My head hurts .
Punditry has left me a blithering jelly of angst and indecision .
It is probably my own fault .
Like an idiot , I tried to stay informed about Iraq , but it was all for nought .
The world is significantly loopier when right-wing British columnist Taki agrees with John Pilger , and John Howard with Tony Blair .
It is enough to make me call out for my Mum .

I do n't like Saddam Hussein but I do like international law , but that 's no help because even the lawyers ca n't agree .
( Maybe I should n't be surprised as they are paid not to agree . )
Blix obfuscates , Blair fulminates , Bush belligerates and builds the biggest bomb , and all the while Baghdad brutalises .
What ?
`` Belligerates '' is n't a word ?
Who cares ?
I 'm confused .

Maybe you could n't help noticing all the Bs involved in this nasty business .
And the biggest B of all , even bigger than the biggest bomb , stands for `` boys '' .
Which brings me back to Mum .
When I was a kid , I would come home from being smacked around the footy field and she would run me a bath and put the kettle on .
Then we would sit and chat a haven of common sense and calm .
There was n't a problem we could n't solve .

True , many of them related to our next holiday , but we assessed a lot of people and we easily agreed on who seemed good and true and who did not .
Oh , for a bath and a cuppa now and maybe another slice of that warm orange cake , please .

Maybe George could talk to his mum .
Barbara seems like a nice , sensible , tea-making kind of person .
Tony could talk to Mrs Blair senior , that is , not Cherie .
I am not sure Cherie does tea .
Saddam could even have a cup with his mum .

It has been asked before , but what if we let women have a crack at this problem ?
But is it really helpful to say that if women ran the world we would n't be in this mess in the first place ?
The fact remains that men are in charge and that wo n't change any time soon .
What is also clear is that the men who are meant to look after us have cocked things up and they need some help .

No , ladies , I do not mean by protesting in the streets or taking off your clothes in the park , the latter of which must have Iraqis more than a little perplexed .
The men in charge need a new way of looking at things .
They need ideas .
Quickly .

For some time I have been convinced that there must be a way to exploit the frighteningly immense neural capacity which , by self-choice or prejudice , has been left untapped in the search for solutions to the world 's problems .
Think of SETI@home , which uses internet-connected home computers , running a program disguised as a screen saver , to search for extraterrestrial intelligence .

On Earth we must have a jillion women a vast super-computer with a human face and , what is more , a kindly female face .
Let 's fire it up and give it a whirl .
Come on , ladies , it 's over to you .

I can hear the collective hum of minds quietly working now and it sounds reassuring .
And unlike men , women will be able to multi-task , to solve the world 's problems while ensuring children are nourished , partners feel loved and daytime jobs are performed .

But the question is : are you up for it ?
Sure , you may be equal to the challenge but can you be bothered to accept it ?
I fear that , just as Mr Bush looks up from his Bible before pressing the big button , he will look around to see that , while Rumsfeld and Powell are rolling around fighting on the eagle-adorned carpet , Condi Rice and Mrs Bush have quietly slipped out .
They will have gone off to join the world 's women in one of the immense spacecraft they have been secretly constructing .
Armed with a lot of chocolate and a few straws of semen , they will head off to colonise space .
Goodbye , and thanks for all the lawnmowing .

Help , Mum !
