<p><strong>Name:</strong> "George Peter Kapiniaris."<br /><br /><strong>Claim to fame?</strong> "For the past 26 years I've been a film, TV, theatre, music and stand-up performer; I haven't done any other job apart from writing and drama teaching. Some people think that's quite an accomplishment; sometimes I wish I had a normal nine-to-five job like 99% of actors in this country. My claim to fame would have to be <em>Acropolis Now</em> and all the <em>Wog </em>shows that I've created and been a part of (Memo being the most famous of my roles), but there are many more milestones in my career including the lawyer in <em>Underbelly </em>(Eddie told me I wasn't allowed to say his name). And for Adelaide readers, I've been the RAA Insurance guy for the last decade."</p>
<p><strong>Favourite coffee in Melbourne?</strong> "Bill's Cafe in Tunstall Square, Donvale. The guy's a genius, and tall, even though I like my lattes short and without a handle."</p>
<p><strong>Favourite place to get a meal?</strong> "Hellenic Republic for a fun dinner and The Press club for a serious dinner. Both are owned by George Calombaris and both have recipes that he's pinched off his mum. Favourite 'meal event' would have to be The Pantry Cooking Show at The Pantry in Brighton, with shows put on by the greatest showman chefs in the world, my favourites being George Calombaris, Guy Grossi, Manu, Pete Evans and Frank Camorra."</p>
<p><strong>Favourite shop?</strong> "Gallin's Guitar Shop in Nunawading; I love guitars, I go in there and dream of one day owning all of them. Every classic Gibson and Epiphone model available, the Les Paul and Flying V being my favourites. I dont really want to play them, just stand in front of the mirror and try on different outfits while holding them. Is that weird? In fact when I think of them I start to cry; I imagine little Epiphone mandolins with little bows in baskets... oh no, I'm turning into the YouTube cat lady."</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Melbourne memory?</strong> "First time I saw the Tigers play at the MCG; I was in grade six and I got a free ticket off my teacher at Yarra Park Primary. Royce Hart was on fire that day in the famous number four. Our current number four [Dustin Martin] is a bit like that too. No doubt my two young boys will be wearing that number to the footy when they go to their first game. That's if they barrack for the Tigers!"</p>
<p><strong>What's your best-kept Melbourne secret? </strong>"People think I'm Greek; I'm actually Scottish. I just did it so I could get a gig on Melbourne TV. With 500,000 Greeks living in this city, I couldn't go wrong!"</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on at the moment?</strong> "I've just finished a film called <em>Big Mamma's Boy</em>, which will be opening in cinemas on July 28 - a day after my birthday - as well as touring around the country with the Standup show <em>Il Dago 2</em>, which is cruising towards our 300th performance. Pretty good for a show that was launched three years ago at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival!"</p>
