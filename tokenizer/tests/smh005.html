<p>A SYDNEY coffee company has devised a system to save thousands of plastic milk bottles and it's as simple as turning on the tap.</p>
<p>Single Origin Roasters, which operates a coffee house and the Sideshow takeaway bar in Surry Hills, has developed a pump which takes milk straight from a fridge to the barista's jug.</p>
<p>The tap, running in prototype form at Sideshow, is connected by pipe to a 10-litre container in the fridge: the industry standard quantity delivered by suppliers to cafes. The milk is cold and, importantly, consistent. A simple stop/start button on the counter dispenses the milk ready for frothing, removing the two-litre plastic bottle from the equation.</p>
<p>''If we had a manifesto for this little [business], it would have</p>
<p>to be one of simply looking at unmet needs in the cafe,'' said Ross Nicholls, Single Origin's industrial designer. ''It's an opportunity using Single Origin's contacts and insight into the world of coffee to develop some really cool products that answer those needs.''</p>
<p>If Australians have poured beer from the tap for decades, why has the milk pump been so long in the waiting? ''Milk is not beer and it's not water,'' Mr Nicholls said. ''If you don't move it correctly, you destroy it before it even gets to the jug, so you destroy its ability to be textured properly … It defies everything you know about liquid.''</p>
<p>Over the next three months, Single Origin plans to introduce the system to cafes around Sydney - ''an exclusive limited run in the hands of the best baristas in town,'' said company co-founder Emma Cohen. Patents are also being sought. The product will then go on sale to cafe owners here and overseas, potentially saving them thousands of dollars on plastic waste disposal costs and discarded milk. By Single Origin's numbers, if enough cafes switch to the milk tap system and each saves up to 10,000 two-litre bottles per annum, the waste reduction figure could be in the hundreds of tonnes.</p>
<p>''There are so many benefits to the industry as a whole in terms of helping cafes become a greener environment … and [giving] the customer a more hygienic and a more consistently textured coffee each time,'' says Ms Cohen. The standard dosages dispensed by the unit can be modified, and don't take away from the hands-on satisfaction of the barista's work. ''We aren't designing things to take skills or enjoyment out of anybody's hands. They are merely optimised tools that give the user the best experience they can,'' Mr Nicholls said.</p>
<p>''A chef only wants to work with the best ingredients at the right temperature,'' Ms Cohen added. ''The colder the milk is, the easier it is for the barista to work with.''</p>
