<p>The buyers' strike of Australian property sought by a tax reform group last month has proven to be a fizzer, precisely because some people don't like the idea of lower house prices.</p>
<p>Online activist group GetUp decided not to pursue a strike of home purchases to protest the lack of affordability in the housing market because its own members didn't like the idea.</p>
<p>“While the issue of housing affordability is clearly an issue that resonates with plenty of people, GetUp members don't support a boycott campaign,” wrote Kelsey Cooke, online community coordinator for GetUp late last week.</p>
<p>"Over the course of the last couple of weeks, we surveyed a random segment of our membership to gauge support - only 10 per cent strongly support the campaign, and more than half the surveyed members opposed this campaign altogether."</p>
<p>But with home prices wilting, auction clearance rates sinking and a wave of housing stock flooding the market, a strike on home purchases would make placards and bullhorns at Saturday morning auctions irrelevant, one analyst said.</p>
<p>In the year to April, the stock of houses and units coming on the market has jumped 69 per cent to 367,500 properties, according to property analysis group SQM Research. Over the same period, the flood of stock available in Melbourne has soared 105 per cent to 43,500. In Sydney, the number rose a more moderate 54 per cent to 33,400.</p>
<p>With those kinds of numbers, SQM managing director Louis Christopher said a buyers' strike was unnecessary.</p>
<p>“There is definitely a decline occurring,” he said, blaming 2010's four interest rates rises which have pushed up the average rate for a home loan to about 7 per cent.</p>
<p>“That's too much for many home buyers and would-be home buyers,” said Mr Christopher. “The reason 7 per cent is too much is because of our highly geared market.”</p>
<p>RP Data Rismark said the national city median dwelling price was $455,000 in March.</p>
<p>First home buyers have stepped back since the end of the boost to the First Home Owners Grant in 2010. The share of first-time home buyers had dropped to 14.9 per cent in February, the lowest ratio since June 2004, and just half of the peak of 28.5 per cent in May 2009 when the federal government offered incentives to draw in first-time buyers.</p>
<p>National home prices on a quarterly basis sank 2.1 per cent in the March quarter - the biggest decline since RP Data Rismark began collecting the data in June 1999.</p>
<p>Mr Christopher predicts the market will fall 5 to 10 per cent over the next year and half, on the official Australian Bureau of Statistics measure.</p>
<p>By some measures, auction clearance rates have fallen into the low 50 per cent range in Melbourne and Sydney in 2011, well down from the highs of 80 per cent last year, during a period of historically low interest rates and the after-effects of the governments First Home Owner Grant boost brought in during the financial crisis.</p>
<p>To date, Melbourne’s auction listings for May have averaged 683 per weekend, up 24 per cent on the 20-year average for the month, the Real Estate Institute of Victoria said.  </p>
<p>“Due to the high volume of auctions and cautious market there will be a lot of negotiating when vendors' price expectations are not realized, as has been the case with two out of five auctions this year,’’ said REIV spokesman Robert Larocca.</p>
<p>Lending for housing increased at 6.6 per cent in the year to March, the smallest gain in the history of the RBA data series, which began in 1976, according to data released by the Reserve Bank last week.</p>
<p>The home buyers' strike, the brainchild of Prosper Australia, a little-known group that supports tax reform on land, garnered 7000 votes on the GetUp campaign forum, rocketing to the top of the list of proposed issues after it was introduced in mid-March.</p>
<p>GetUp's decision not to pursue the campaign was unsurprising, said Prosper's David Collyer.</p>
<p>“The Buyers Strike is a call for direct economic action; GetUp is a lobbying/political campaigning site,” he said.</p>
<p>“They rarely lobby for economic change, instead push for issues that struggle for funding. One day it will be recognised that economics is central to all such issues.”</p>
