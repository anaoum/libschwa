THINGS were a little tense at the Parents and Citizens meeting. Uniforms were on the agenda, or, more specifically, tracksuit pants. Some parents were concerned their daughters' legs were feeling a tad cold. They suggested tracksuit pants as part of the winter uniform for girls. "Buy some thicker woolly tights," I felt like saying, but didn't.<p />I believe the issue goes deeper than warmth. I believe some parents find the current uniform high maintenance. Tracksuit pants are a wash-and-wear affair, needing no separate wash, no scrubbing, no ironing and no darning. Despite this very tempting domestic advantage, I can't help feel that fleecy, baggy pants with elasticised waists just don't make the grade. <p />There are those that will argue "clothes don't maketh the man". True, but there's something about rows of students in striped ties, crisp shirts, blazers with crests, tartan dresses and boaters that makes old men nod in approval and convinces pregnant women to ring principals to make a booking for their unborn child. <p />Call me old fashioned, but uniforms make children presentable. They may be cheeky and unruly, but they look good. They may hang around shopping centres, or not stand up for the elderly on buses, but at least those pregnant women can identify the school, ring up the principal and cancel that booking.<p />Uniforms are not fashionable - most of us would rather be caught wearing trackie daks than wear one. But that's the whole point. There are no labels. Everyone wears the same. Without a strict, detailed tracksuit pant policy, our playground will turn into those sporting ticks, pumas and three stripes versus those wearing less prestigious brands. <p />Of course, there's the issue of equality. If the girls wear the trackie pants in winter, then the boys will have to be allowed to ditch the grey pants and shirts. And then thought must be given as to what to wear with the tracksuit pants. Because the current sport uniform has a white polo, this will probably be suggested, which brings us back to the whole issue of separate washes.<p />Economics will certainly be raised. Is it cheaper to wear tracksuit pants five days a week or nice smart uniforms? I have yet to do a cost analysis. However, anecdotally, my daughter's playground escapades in kindergarten meant she'd come home with a scraped knee peering through a big round hole at least once a week. And because my darning skills leave a lot to be desired I spent a small fortune buying tights to see her through winter. <p />Despite my pleas about not letting the presentation of the school decline, the pro-trackie daks parents were unconvinced. Then someone suggested navy tailored pants as a compromise. We all agreed they would be warm and, more importantly, presentable.
