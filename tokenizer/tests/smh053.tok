What a wonderful world the commercial television networks inhabit .
Most of us grew up with the notion that in any competition there can be only one winner .
But in Tellyworld , everyone is a winner ; and simultaneously , everyone else is a shameful loser .

This became apparent last week when the stations put out their interpretations of how Australians consumed TV during the first six months of this year .
Here 's how they reported the results .

Channel Nine : `` Nine set to win 2005 .
At the mid-year point we have consolidated our position as Australia 's number one network , strengthened our already consistent line-up of quality programming and will once again finish the year number one . ''

Channel Seven : `` Seven building momentum as year unfolds .
Seven is up in every audience demographic .
The Seven network is the only network to deliver audience growth in the current television year . ''

Channel Ten : `` Ten on top and ahead of 2004 .
Network Ten is in pole position in its core 16--39 demographic at the halfway mark of official 2005 ratings .
Ten is substantially in front of the Seven and Nine networks in the year to date . ''

Pay TV : overall viewing up 14 per cent while free-to-air is down 2 per cent .

Noting a certain confusion , Seven came back for a second bite , saying its average audience was up by 125,000 viewers , while Nine 's was down 53,000 , Ten was down 69,000 , pay was up 55,000 ( across 40 channels ) and SBS was up 11,000 .
It concluded : `` The total television market has increased by 1 per cent overall in the five capital cities , which is equivalent to an extra 29,000 viewers watching TV . ''

Are they kidding themselves ?
No , they 're all telling the truth .
Each chose to use the demographics and time periods that gave it the best results .

Here 's the bottom line : Australians over 40 seem to be watching more of Seven , SBS and pay TV than last year , while people between 16 and 39 , particularly in Sydney , seem to be watching less TV , apparently distracted by the internet , DVDs , video games , and real life .
The table at right shows the preferences of the quaint old-fashioned under-40s who stuck with TV this year .

You may find it scary .
