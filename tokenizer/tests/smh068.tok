Goal `` I 'd like to be an actress . ''
She hopes to do a Bachelor of Art ( performance ) at the University of Western Sydney .

I 'm feeling all right , but it 's kind of scary thinking it 's only a few weeks until the trials .

For drama and music we have to make up our own performances .
We have to do a solo performance and a group performance .
I have to finish them soon .

For music , I 'm doing two performances and two viva voces , or spoken exams .

For the vivas I 'm doing `` theatre music '' and `` an instrument and its repertoire '' .
I play the violin and I spend about half an hour a day practising it .

I 'm not really worried about my UAI .
I 'm hoping to get about a 60 to 70 UAI because I can get into heaps of courses with that if I do n't get into drama .

I 've got a study timetable that I use sometimes .
I put in the subjects that I 'm doing the next day .
First , I do the homework -- it 's really important to do the homework or you wo n't get it at all .
When I 've finished that I look over things I 've already done .

I have a whiteboard and I write all the things I have to do on it and when they are due .

I 've got a lot less time for myself -- you ca n't go out that much .

I used to be part of Parramatta Musical Society but I ca n't do it any more -- it would take up way too much time .

I clean the church hall once a week for pocket money .
It takes about two hours .


We 've been rehearsing during the holidays -- I just feel stuffed at the end of a day .
I 'm working on my music stuff because the actual HSC is next term for music and drama , because of the Olympics -- the Olympics are really bad !

I 'm not really thinking about exams yet , so I do n't get stressed .

I have been oking over things a little bit to get started , but I 've also been shopping and going to dance parties and stuff .
