Australian Troy Corser tightened his grip on the World Superbike Championship with a commanding display at Brno in the Czech Republic on Sunday , repeating his result from the previous time the series visited the challenging circuit in 1996 .

On that occasion he put his bike on pole and won both heats .
On Sunday the result was n't quite so perfect , but it was n't bad ; pole position and first and second placings to extend his championship lead over second-placed compatriot Chris Vermeulen .

It was a welcome return to the winner 's circle for Corser , who had n't had a race victory since the Monza round in May , although he has been accruing points with high placings in each round on his Suzuki .

The veteran bolted in the first race , quickly opening a gap on the field and running hard to finish six seconds clear of reigning champion James Toseland , who roughly elbowed Ducati teammate Regis Laconi aside to claim second .
It was Corser 's seventh race win of the season and a psychological blow to those who thought they might have been closing the performance gap .

The second race was red-flagged after two laps due to oil on the track , with Corser deciding to change to his spare bike because he felt the machine from race one was losing pace .
However , there was a slight electronics problem with the second bike that took the edge off its pace and Noriyuki Haga stormed through from 18th on the grid to claim a convincing win for Yamaha .

Vermeulen 's hopes of closing the points gap on Corser evaporated in the first race , when he struggled to a disappointing eighth on his Honda , but a spirited ride in the second heat saw him finish third after passing Norick Abe on the final lap .

The wash-up is that Corser now has 299 points after seven rounds of the series to lead Vermeulen on 205 .
Laconi has 187 , Corser 's struggling teammate Yukio Kagayama has 158 and Toseland is out of contention on 152 .

Vermeulen 's Australian teammate Karl Muggeridge scored only 13th and ninth places , while Garry McCoy was far from pleased about the manner in which he crashed out of the first heat .
He needed six stitches in a gashed elbow and suffered minor concussion and an ankle injury in the fifth-lap incident , which he blamed on Spanish rider Jose Luis Cardoso .
Two other riders were brought down in the incident .
McCoy did n't start in the second race and will miss a two-day test in Germany this week .

In the supporting world supersport event , Australian Kevin Curtain crashed his Yamaha while battling for the lead with eventual winner Sebastien Charpentier ( Honda ) .

Curtain 's Australian teammate Broc Parkes also failed to finish , being forced to pull out with mechanical problems while challenging for third .
