<p>Brisbane can begin thinking about the huge task of rebuilding, after it was confirmed the worst of the flood crisis had passed.</p>
<p>The Brisbane River was expected to surge again at 4pm today, but the waters continued to recede from the early morning peak of 4.46 metres.</p>
<p>While they may have to wait months before they can return to their homes, flood-affected residents have been assured the river level has begun its slow return to normal.</p>
<p>“The river is falling and it will continue falling,” hydrographer Russell Denton said this afternoon.</p>
<p>“The worst is gone. We’re not going to see a fresh rise.”</p>
<p>Mr Denton said by 5am tomorrow the river would decline to 3.2 metres, which is 0.3 metres below a major flood level.</p>
<p>The river was at 3.75 metres and falling at 3.42pm.</p>
<p><strong>Brisbane death</strong></p>
<p>Brisbane residents have been given a tragic reminder to remain out of floodwaters, after a 24-year-old man was sucked into a drain in Durack.</p>
<p>The man's death was the third confirmed today, along with the the discovery of a male body in Myall Creek near Dalby and another in a field in Grantham.</p>
<p>They take the death toll from this week's flood crisis to 15, while 61 remain missing. There were "grave fears" for 12 of those, Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said.</p>
<p>Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the man found at Durack was trying to do the right thing by checking his father’s property, but his death had been avoidable.</p>
<p>She implored residents to stay out of floodwaters to avoid another tragedy.</p>
<p>“This incident is not over. Floodwaters are moving very fast … it is still a very dangerous situation,” she said.</p>
<p>The bodies of two men killed in Queensland’s savage floods are being flown from the Lockyer Valley to Brisbane this evening.</p>
<p>A Defence helicopter with the bodies was due to arrive at Nathan in the city’s south about 6.30pm.</p>
<p><strong>'Tourists' causing problems</strong></p>
<p>Main Roads Minister Craig Wallace said emergency services were becoming increasingly frustrated by people treating the floods as a “tourist attraction”. <br /><br />Dozens of people arriving in their cars to rubberneck at the devastation are creating further waves of water, further damaging businesses and road infrastructure, he said.</p>
<p>Minister Wallace said dirty water was pushing into Brisbane properties as drivers ploughed through the murky floodwaters.</p>
<p>“This is not a tourist attraction, it’s a tragedy,” he said. “If you are not assisting the effort, please stay at home.</p>
<p>“Our priority is to keep these roads clear for police, emergency services, and evacuees during our response and recovery stage.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Residents receive reprieve</strong></p>
<p>Lord Mayor Campbell Newman today announced flood victims would be afforded $100 worth of water free of charge to clean their properties.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of water. If you think of a normal gardening hose, one kilolitre of water is released after just an hour of watering and that equates to about $1.80 under today’s charges,” he told ABC Radio.</p>
<p>Brisbane City Council will also give flood victims an extra 30 days to pay their rates bills.</p>
<p>The council will not operate parking meters or enforce timed parking zones and parking bays for 30 days in flood affected areas, particularly for those people who have moved their vehicles to higher ground.</p>
<p><strong>Returning home may take months</strong></p>
<p>Earlier today, the Premier warned that some Brisbane residents may not be able to move back into their flood-affected homes for months.</p>
<p>Residents in the Queensland capital this morning awoke to the good news the river has peaked at 4.46 metres, more than a metre below the predicted peak of 5.5m. The 1974 flood, the worst of last century, was 5.45 metres.</p>
<p>But while the news was better than expected, scores of homes have still been inundated, and thousands of Brisbane residents remain evacuated from their homes.</p>
<p>The Premier warned the state was facing a reconstruction effort of ‘‘post-war proportions’’. More than 15,000 residential and commercial properties have been affected by significant flooding.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said people in evacuation centres may be able to look at their inundated homes ‘‘some time’’ over the weekend.</p>
<p>‘‘They won’t be able to get in to clean them until they’ve had electrical certification and are made safe,’’ she told ABC Radio.</p>
<p>''They may not be able to move back into their homes for literally months. So, there is a very big dislocation effort we have to manage very carefully.’’</p>
<p>Almost 1000 people remain in evacuation centres across Brisbane. The RNA Showgrounds at Bowen Hills is housing 647 people, with a further 323 at the QEII Stadium at Nathan.</p>
<p>Police have established another centre at the Kedron Wavell Services Club on Hamilton Road for people who cannot get to the other locations.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Life disrupted</strong></p>
<p>As they try and cope with the flood crisis, Brisbane’s residents are having to deal with <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/blackouts-strike-120000-across-seq-20110111-19mn9.html"><strong>power shortages</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/flood-zone-faces-food-beer-shortages-20110113-19oxd.html"><strong>supermarket closures</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Retailers have warned some supermarket shelves could remain empty for days, and people may struggle to buy staples, including dairy products and bread.</p>
<p>Power might not be returned to the CBD for days.</p>
<p><strong>CBD at a standstill</strong></p>
<p>The heart of Brisbane’s central business district has been engulfed by the flood that has devastated the city.</p>
<p>Floodwaters began entering the area yesterday and early this morning a knee-deep body of water covered much of Eagle Street, which houses Brisbane’s Stock Exchange and the Prime Minister’s city office.</p>
<p>The pool of murky water extends to the bottom of Creek Street, and up Charlotte Street to the Elizabeth Street intersection.</p>
<p>While the city’s corporate workers have abandoned the area, groups of onlookers have gathered to take photos of the remarkable scene.</p>
<p>Police warned people to avoid travelling to the CBD today unless  absolutely necessary, and urged   sightseers to stay away from the river  because they could hamper   emergency service workers.</p>
<p><strong>Suburbs submerged</strong></p>
<p>The suburbs identified as being the worst-hit by the flooding were Brisbane City, St Lucia, West End, Rocklea and Graceville.</p>
<p>Almost the entire suburbs of Yeronga and Fairfield <strong><a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/by-morning-the-whole-house-was-under-20110113-19ow6.html">have been  consumed</a></strong>, with the water stretching at least three blocks from the  river.</p>
<p>Rows of streets have disappeared, with the breadth of the  water so great onlookers are being kept hundreds of metres from the  centre of the devastation.</p>
<p>Countless homes are completely submerged. At others,  roofs are peaking above the water while still more homes have muddy  water part way up their walls.</p>
