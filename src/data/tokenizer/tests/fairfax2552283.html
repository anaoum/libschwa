<p>More homeowners are worried about a decline in the value of their house following a drop in home prices since the start of 2011, says a new survey.</p>
<p>The data showed 26 per cent of respondents expected prices to fall in the year to next July, up from 17 per cent when the last survey was done in April.</p>
<p>But the number of optimists still outweighed pessimists, with 42 per cent of respondents expecting prices to rise, despite that number falling below 50 per cent for the first time since the May 2009.</p>
<p>The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer House Price Expectations Index, released today, also showed over 32 per cent of consumers expect prices to remain steady in the 12 months ahead in July.</p>
<p>"Consumers haven't turned pessimistic on prices but the shift in momentum bears close attention given the fragile consumer mood more generally," said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan.</p>
<p>A survey of the residential property sector in the June quarter, released by National Australia Bank yesterday, echoed the findings.</p>
<p>The property sector predicted national home prices would drop by 1.4 per cent in the 12 months from June, turning around an earlier forecast that home values would rise 0.6 per cent in the 12 months from last March.</p>
<p>Mirroring the result of the NAB survey, Victoria's house price expectations index suffered the biggest fall over the past three months, Westpac said, dropping from 52.7 in April to 20.1 in July. New South Wales also fell, moving from 43.8 to 23.7 in the same period.</p>
<p>"Prices have been weaker than consumers expected – the median forward view in April last year was for a 5.7 per cent rise, dwelling prices have instead dipped 1.4 per cent in the year to April," said Mr Hassan.</p>
<p>More recently, home prices slipped 2.7 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in the first five months of 2011, RP Data said in June.</p>
<p>The breakdown of optimists versus pessimists points to no price change over the year, Westpac said, but that reading was down from an implied median price rise of 1.2 per cent for the year seen in the April consumer confidence survey and 1.9 per cent in the January reading.</p>
<p>"House price expectations clearly took a knock in the three months to July with a downgrade on a par with that seen in July last year which followed a 160 basis point rise in mortgage rates over the previous twelve months," said Mr Hassan.</p>
<p>"With rates on hold since November, it suggests the level of interest rates is weighing on demand sufficiently to see prices weaken of their own accord.</p>
<p>"Those with a mortgage or in first home buyer age-groups tended to have somewhat more resilient house price expectations. Price expectations fell more sharply for age-groups that tend to drive investor demand."</p>
<p>The Westpac data is linked to the consumer confidence reading for July, released Wednesday, which showed sentiment broadly was at a two-year low. The slump in consumer confidence has been blamed on higher interest rates, uncertainty about the global economy and even speculation about a higher cost of living linked the carbon trading scheme.</p>
<p>The same slump has afflicted the property market, where auction clearance rates in Melbourne and Sydney have slowed dramatically in 2011. Borrowing for new homes remains weak while higher priced homes are selling for less than their asking price in many local markets.</p>
<p>Westpac said optimism was strongest in Western Australia, where the price expectation index increased to 24.8 from 17.6. In South Australia it dropped to 1.3 in July from 22.7 in April. In Queensland, it fell into negative territory, at -6.2 from 21.4 in April.</p>
<p>The Westpac index is calculated by the share of respondents expecting price rises minus the share expecting a fall.</p>
