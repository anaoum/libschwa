<p>Goal &quot;I'd like to be an actress.&quot; She hopes to do a Bachelor of Art
(performance) at the University of Western Sydney.
<p>I'm feeling all right, but it's kind of scary thinking it's only a few weeks
until the trials.
<p>   For drama and music we have to make up our own performances. We have to do
 a solo performance and a group performance. I have to finish them soon.
<p>For music, I'm doing two performances and two viva voces, or spoken exams.
<p>For the vivas I'm doing &quot;theatre music&quot; and &quot;an instrument and its
repertoire&quot;. I play the violin and I spend about half an hour a day practising
it.
<p>I'm not really worried about my UAI. I'm hoping to get about a 60 to 70 UAI
because I can get into heaps of courses with that if I don't get into drama.
<p>I've got a study timetable that I use sometimes. I put in the subjects that
I'm doing the next day. First, I do the homework - it's really important to do
the homework or you won't get it at all. When I've finished that I look over
things I've already done.
<p>I have a whiteboard and I write all the things I have to do on it and when
they are due.
<p>I've got a lot less time for myself - you can't go out that much.
<p>I used to be part of Parramatta Musical Society but I can't do it any more -
it would take up way too much time.
<p>I clean the church hall once a week for pocket money. It takes about two
hours.
<p>We've been rehearsing during the holidays - I just feel stuffed at the end of
 a day. I'm working on my music stuff because the actual HSC is next term for
music and drama, because of the Olympics - the Olympics are really bad!
<p>I'm not really thinking about exams yet, so I don't get stressed.
<p>I have been oking over things a little bit to get started, but I've also been
 shopping and going to dance parties and stuff.I have been looking over things a
