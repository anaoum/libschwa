Fischer travels frequently between Tokyo and Manila in recent years. A federal warrant for the arrest of Bobby Fischer was issued in Columbia (USA) on 15th December 1992 for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing an exhibition match there against Spassky in 1992. According to Japanese news reports 61-year-old Fischer would probably be deported to the USA but Richard Boucher, the USA State Department spokesman, said it was not yet determined whether the USA would ask that Fischer be turned over to American authorities.
