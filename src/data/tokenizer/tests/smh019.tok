The centrepiece of the Federal Government 's so-called education revolution may be worse than useless , a visiting American researcher says .

Before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd vowed to spend $ 2.3 billion rewarding parents who installed or bought home computers .

He later said his decisions would be evidence based .

Jacob Vigdor , of Duke University , North Carolina , has conducted what is probably the world 's biggest study on the effect on maths and reading scores of gaining a home computer .
He finds `` statistically significant '' evidence that it sends them backwards .

`` Children in homes with computers tend to do better than those in homes without there 's no doubt about that , '' Professor Vigdor told the Herald .

`` But there could be other reasons .
Those homes also have a lot of other things other homes do n't have , and often have more educated parents . ''

He examined the performance of students before and after their home gained a computer .
This meant examining students from less well-off homes .
The better-off ones already had computers .

But Professor Vigdor told a seminar at Australian National University he did not think this was an important limitation .

Professor Vigdor found that acquiring a computer at home made end-of-year results for year 3 to year 8 students in North Carolina `` significantly worse '' in reading and maths .
These results were spread over five years .

`` The bad effects fade somewhat over time , but even after five years they are still negative .
I am not saying go out and burn all the computers .

`` If you want to buy junior a computer with your own dollars , that 's fine ... but it 's another thing when we talk about spending public dollars . ''
