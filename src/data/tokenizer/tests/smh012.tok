Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has launched a royal commission-style inquiry into the state 's devastating and deadly floods .

The $ 15 million inquiry , to be headed by Justice Cate Holmes , will examine the disaster , government preparedness and the emergency response .

Ms Bligh said the operation of dams , including the adequacy of water releases from Wivenhoe , would be among issues investigated .

Ms Bligh announced the commission of inquiry this afternoon after confirming the death toll from the floods had risen to 20 , with another body discovered at Grantham .

A death in a vehicle in Ipswich last week had also been deemed flood related .
More than 10 people were still missing .

Ms Bligh said she expected the inquiry team to visit the towns and cities inundated by the floods so that local people could attend hearings and give evidence .

The independent inquiry would have the powers of a royal commission including the ability to summon witnesses , require documents to be produced , and issue search warrants , she said .

Ms Bligh said she would be prepared to attend the inquiry if called to give evidence and the public should be confident the government was `` not going to sweep anything under the carpet '' .

The terms of reference require the inquiry to examine the adequacy of forecasts and early warning systems , particularly regarding the flooding in Toowoomba and the Lockyer and Brisbane valleys .

The preparation and planning by federal , state and local governments and emergency services will also come under the spotlight .

Ms Bligh also wants the inquiry to report on the operation of dams across the state , including the release strategies from the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams , and whether flood mitigation was appropriate .

The inquiry will also investigate land use planning and development in flood-prone areas and the performance of private insurers in fulfilling claims

Ms Bligh said the disaster needed to be examined thoroughly .

`` The last three weeks have been truly shocking for all Queenslanders and now is the time to forensically examine the devastating chain of events and the aftermath , '' Ms Bligh said .

The head of the new inquiry , Justice Holmes , is a sitting Supreme Court judge and was counsel assisting the Forde Royal Commission into child abuse in 1998 .

She will be assisted by two deputy commissioners , former Queensland police commissioner Jim O'Sullivan , and the chairman of the International Commission on Large Dams , Phil Cummins .

`` Our government has appointed three highly respected people to undertake that task and I want to honour those people who have lost their lives through this disaster by ensuring all possible lessons are learnt , '' Ms Bligh said .

The initial budget for the inquiry would be $ 15 million , Ms Bligh said .

`` I know that sounds like a lot of money but this is an investment in our future safety , '' she said .

An interim report on flood preparedness issues is due by August 1 this year so they can be implemented before next summer 's wet season .

The final report is due by January 17 next year .
