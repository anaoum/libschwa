In a culture as obsessed with looks as ours , is it any surprise people occasionally use their appearance to get ahead ?
Yes , I 'm ashamed to admit that even I 've done it .
More than once , I 've sashayed into an office clad in little more than a painfully short skirt and too much make-up .
Sadly , it 's never worked , quite possibly because I 'm not a woman .
I was refused my sought-after pay rise , and my self-esteem suffered a bruising blow when all my colleagues scurried for the nearest fire escape ( Thus teaching me that mauve and turquoise just do n't mix ) .
True vamps successfully get their way through sexy clothes , perfect cheekbones and suggestive smiles .
But beware : they often have the morals of a cornered Heather Locklear .
