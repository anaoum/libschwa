Oscar Wilde once lamented the difficulties of "the love that dare not speak its name". Little did he know that a century later it would be more of a concern trying to find a love that would, even for the barest of moments, keep its mouth shut.<p />Romantic comedies. Reality television. Online dating websites. Speed dating. Documentaries about American women and their sexual obsessions with toasters. There is no limit to the amount of vocalised love being shared across every available medium, in particular the internet.<p />Cue CyberLover, a Russian software robot (known as a "bot") that poses as a would-be paramour in sex chatrooms. While the use of love to hoodwink unsuspecting dorks is as old as the dirt, the use of so-called slutbots is a relatively new innovation.<p />According to a report from the tech site PC Tools, the slutbot can conduct automated "flirtatious" conversations with up to 10 people in 30 minutes. During conversations it is programmed to garner personal information and lure correspondents to other websites where they are infected with malware (malicious software). <p />"CyberLover demonstrates an unprecedented level of social engineering," an expert in software designed to damage computer systems, Sergei Shevchenko, told the site. <p />"It employs highly intelligent and customised dialogue to target users of social networking systems."<p />It can operate in a number of different personality modes, varying from "romantic lover" to the particularly appealing "sexual predator". Not to mention that CyberLover could present an even greater risk if paired with emerging technology.<p />When a robotics futurist declared in 2006 that people would be having sex with robots "within five years" society (outside of Japan) shivered.<p />Now, with only three years to go until this prophesied robo-sexual revolution, the danger of merging technologies should be a concern.<p />Imagine the CyberLove program inserted into the mainframe of a robotic Scarlett Johansson; surely the bank accounts of every red-blooded man in the world would be in peril. Thankfully, attempts thus far to make life-like robo-dolls have resulted in creations no more human-looking than Pamela Anderson. But how long will that techno-sexual frontier remain unbreached? Eventually some spotty, single scientist is going to perfect the android, and then we are all in big trouble.<p />So while PC Tools has provided some ways to protect yourself from the unwelcome advances of the current CyberLover, it provides no advice on future incarnations.<p />Updating your virus protection and limiting the amount of personal information you give out to strangers on the web are the best ways to protect yourself from CyberLover at the moment, PC Tools says.<p />However, it offers no advice on what to do if the minxbot is in your lounge room, dressed in a small black dress and patent leather pumps, smiling demurely as it surreptitiously uploads your credit card details to a server in Vladivostok.<p />Perhaps that is for another issue.
