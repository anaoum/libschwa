Susan, the woman raised in the central western town of Cumnock who became the wife of Leka, the pretender to the Albanian throne, died on Saturday in Albania.<p />"Her Majesty Susan I Zog is no longer with us," spokesman Fluturak Germenji announced in Tirana, the capital.<p />He said she had died from a heart condition although a brother, John Cullen Ward, said in Forster that his sister was being treated for cancer. She was 63. <p />Born Susan Barbara Cullen Ward, she married King Leka in Biarritz in 1975 after meeting him at a Sydney dinner party.<p />Barry Everingham, a commentator on royal families who has represented Leka and Susan in Australia, said the marriage was a "love match" and King Leka would be devastated. However, in many ways, she had led a sad life, moving from one country to another while her husband tried in vain to capture the crown once worn by his father, King Zog.<p />Susan, one of five children, attended the Presbyterian Ladies College in Orange, where she later taught art.<p />Her marriage at 34 to Leka followed a failed first union. Guests at the wedding shouted "Long live the king!", then acknowledged the Spanish dictator, "Long Live Franco!"<p />King Zog fled with his wife, Geraldine, two-day-old son Leka, and some of the Albanian treasury when Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator, occupied Albania in World War II.<p />After Zog died in 1961, monarchist emigres declared Leka their king at the Bristol Hotel in Paris.<p />Leka denied being on the CIA payroll in the late 1960s and early 1970s and Susan later denied another common allegation, that her husband was an arms dealer.<p />The couple lived in Madrid until Spain expelled them when an arms cache was found at their home. He had been arrested earlier in Thailand on charges of arms smuggling.<p />Leka and Susan went to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, until the whites lost power, and then to South Africa, where they lost diplomatic favours after Nelson Mandela won office.<p />Australian authorities refused to recognise Susan as a queen but, in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister, issued a passport in the name of "Susan Cullen Ward, known as Queen Susan".<p />Leka and Susan returned to Albania a few years after communism crumbled in 1990. They were ordered out by the first democratically-elected president, Sali Berisha. <p />They went back in 1997, when Leka lost a referendum on the monarchy that he claimed was manipulated. <p />Maureen Cullen Ward, a cousin, said yesterday: "Susan was very nice, very clever, cool and with a great sense of humour."<p />Mr Everingham said: "She was a woman of great dignity who became enamoured by her husband's dream to return to the monarchy."<p />With agencies
