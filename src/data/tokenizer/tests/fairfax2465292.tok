There was plenty for Australian investors at the latest Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting .
Early on , Warren Buffett mentioned that Berkshire had made about $ 100 million last year in just two currencies -- and the Australian dollar was one of them .

That much was reported by several media outlets following the meeting .
But arguably the most interesting comment came next .
Buffett said the Australian dollar could be in for a huge movement , `` and it could be quite dramatic in either direction .
I do n't know which . ''
He said that was why Berkshire no longer had a large bet . ''

That 's quite a statement from a man whose tendency is to say less rather than more on such matters ( Buffett typically prefers to stick with sharemarket and general business matters ) .
Yet say it he did .

The vice-chairman of Berkshire , Charlie Munger , then added an open-ended comment to Buffett 's remarks : `` Australia has these fabulous open-pit mines , which [ is great ] when Asia is booming . ''
And perhaps not so great when it is n't .

If Asia 's development continues apace and the US keeps printing money , another billionaire investor , Jim Rogers , may be right .
He has suggested the Australian dollar could reach $US 1.40 .

Three categories

Yet it 's easy enough to see the downside .
China could stumble , or our property prices might fall dramatically .
Either of those eventualities would likely see the Australian dollar weaken markedly .

Buffett also weighed in on another topic close to Australian hearts -- commodities -- after one shareholder complained that Berkshire 's share price had barely kept pace with inflation since his purchase in 2006 , while his gold holdings had performed spectacularly .

At the hundreds of annual meetings I 've attended , such questions are typically met by corporate bluster or defensive posturing .
But Buffett is several cuts above the average .
He took the opportunity to point out that when he took over Berkshire , its share price was equivalent to three-quarters of an ounce of gold .
`` So gold -- even at $US 1500 ( $ 1400 ) -- still has a way to go '' , he said , implying a comparison with Berkshire Hathaway 's price of more than $US 120,000 and tacitly emphasising a longer-term perspective .

He could have left the topic there but , instead , delivered a lecture on what he saw as the three categories of investments .

Gold is useless

The first is anything denominated in a currency , such as cash , bonds or current accounts .
`` Any currency-related investment is a bet on how the government will behave in future , '' Buffett said , citing Zimbabwe as an example .

The second category of investments are `` items you buy that do n't produce anything but that you hope someone will pay you more for later on '' .
He then spoke at length about the uselessness of gold .

Buffett said that if all the gold ever mined were melted into a single cube , it would be about 20 metres on each side and weigh about 165,000 to 167,000 tonnes .
`` You could climb on it , fondle it , polish it , stare at it .
But it is n't going to do anything .
You 're hoping someone will buy it from you later on . ''

The third category is productive assets .
These are assets about which you can make a rational calculation and measure whether their performance over time matches your initial expectations .
Buffett advised that , over time , speculating in commodities has not been the way to get rich .
Owning good businesses has been .

Productive assets

The mini-lecture closed with a powerful illustration .
Buffett said the sum total of gold ever mined , at today 's price , is worth about $US 8 trillion .

He invited the audience to consider what else that amount of money could buy : all of the farmland in the lower 48 US states ( estimated at $US 2 trillion ) , 10 ExxonMobils ( it boasts a market value of more than $US 400 billion ) and you could `` stick a trillion in your pocket for walking-around money '' .

While admitting to past investments in oil ( at $US 10 a barrel ) and silver ( which has industrial uses ) , Buffett took several other opportunities to underline his preference for investing in productive assets over non-productive ones .

At a time when everyone 's eyes are on commodity prices , such clear-headed explanations are more than useful and deserve all the more weight when they come from a man who has built a $US 50 billion fortune .
