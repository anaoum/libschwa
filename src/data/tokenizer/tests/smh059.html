Warriors 34 South Sydney 20<p />South Sydney coach Arthur Kitinas took aim at his halves, Joe Williams and Owen Craigie, as the Rabbitohs yesterday missed a chance to almost certainly consign the New Zealand Warriors to the wooden spoon.<p />Twenty-year-old halfback Williams was hero and villain as the Warriors experienced back-to-back home wins for the first time this season, running in two late tries to win by 14 points at Ericsson Stadium.<p />Craigie, who with Williams was outstanding in the previous week's destruction of Penrith, was also off-key at vital times, especially with his kicking.<p />"Joe is coming along but I thought he took a couple of steps back today because both he and Owen were probably a little bit disappointing in keeping to what our game plan was supposed to be," Kitinas said. "They didn't have their minds on the job as much as they should have."<p />Williams, in just his seventh NRL match, stole the Rabbitohs' first two tries and had an influential hand in much of the side's activity with the ball.<p />He wasn't always as sharp with his options or direction, though, and further blighted his afternoon when he badly miscued a vital and handy penalty which would have levelled the scores at 22-22 with 11 minutes remaining. <p />In the final seconds he also surrendered possession, allowing Vinnie Anderson to dash away before throwing a "Hail Mary" pass for a dazzling Wairangi Koopu try.<p />The erratic Craigie was guilty of overcooking kicks in a brisk wind that proved significant in determining the match's rhythm.<p />But if there were flaws in Williams's game, there were also uncomfortable moments for his more illustrious opposite, Stacey Jones, who came within millimetres of allowing Souths to snatch the lead for the first time late in the match.<p />Jones, standing in as captain for the injured Monty Betham, had already gifted the Rabbitohs halfback one of his tries. When Williams rolled a grubber kick into the Warriors' in-goal area, the 28-year-old Jones fumbled to present his rival with a try that ignited South Sydney's second-half revival.<p />In an almost freakish replay - and with the Warriors barely holding on at 22-20 - Jones failed to control another grubber but video referee Phil Cooley spared the Kiwi total embarrassment. Replays showed that Jones had recovered just in time to force the ball ahead of Souths winger Shane Marteene, who had already scored two tries.<p />"I was having nightmares there," Jones said. "You always think about those things not happening to you. We're just fortunate that we won the game because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to sleep tonight."<p />Defeat would also have had the effect of rooting the Warriors more firmly to the foot of the ladder. That explained why the Warriors approached the encounter with such intensity.<p />"If we'd lost we would pretty much have had one hand on the wooden spoon," Jones said.<p />It would have left them five points adrift of Souths and two behind Manly. As things stand now, the Warriors, Manly and Souths are within one point of each other, and the Warriors have a bye to come.<p />The Auckland-based side proved to themselves and a crowd of 7894 yesterday that they are far from assured of lasting ignominy just yet.<p />Their success was based on another outstanding first 40 minutes, a near mirror image of their previous home game, when they had raced to an 18-0 half-time lead against Parramatta. <p />Yesterday they were ahead 22-0 until Williams scored just before half-time.<p />In their most scintillating and assured form of a dreadful season, the Warriors set up just their sixth win with some of the extravagant play for which they used to be known. They put the entertainment back in their game with quality tries, a performance blemished only by some ordinary goalkicking from Sione Faumuina.<p />That Souths rushed back with 20 unanswered points inside 18 minutes was nerve-racking for coach Tony Kemp and his staff but they punctuated the contest with a two-try exclamation mark in the final two minutes.<p />The last of them was as stunning as the much-replayed outrageous overhead pass engineered by Faumuina for Evarn Tuimavave to score against Brisbane last year.<p />It was a much-needed reminder - if too late in the season - that these players hadn't quite forgotten what once made them such a feared side.
