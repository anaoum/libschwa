Referees are not under instruction to report rather than send off players for dangerous throws, despite more than 150 players having been charged and none sent off in NRL history.<p />Referees coach Robert Finch yesterday said it was at the referees' discretion whether to send off or report players for dangerous throws, and that he did not direct them on the issue.<p />"It's up to the referees in the case of dangerous throws, the same as with all other incidents," Finch said. "People like to criticise referees whether they send players off or don't send them off, but I'm confident in their ability to make the right decision."<p />Statistics provided by David Middleton's League Information Services show Brisbane prop Shane Webcke yesterday became the 157th player to have been charged with a dangerous throw since the NRL began in 1998. None has been sent from the field.<p />Webcke is expected to plead guilty to the charge to avoid the risk of missing the blockbuster game against the Bulldogs at Telstra Stadium on Friday night.<p />He was charged with a grade-one dangerous throw as a result of a tackle he made on Melbourne winger Jake Webster in Sunday's game at Suncorp Stadium.<p />The former Test star will narrowly escape suspension if he pleads guilty, but if he contests the charge and loses he will be forced out of the match.<p />Asked what he was likely to do, Webcke said last night: "I'm going to go to training tomorrow and talk to Wayne [Bennett, Broncos coach] and Bruno [Cullen, chief executive] and make a decision."<p />But Cullen last night said it was likely Webcke would plead guilty because the way dangerous throws were judged left him unlikely to beat the charge.<p />"There's too much precedent," Cullen said. "Shane thinks he's innocent and we think he's innocent, but once the legs go above the horizontal that seems to be it with this sort of charge."<p />Webcke will have 93 penalty points to his name if he pleads guilty, dangerously close to the 100 mark for a one-match suspension - with the business end of the season approaching.<p />Cullen said it was a consideration that Webcke would be left to carry those points over and be vulnerable to suspension for even the slightest charge on top of that later in the season.<p />But above that, Cullen said, was Webcke's desire to keep playing and not miss such a big game as the one against the Bulldogs.<p />The defending premiers are still outside the top eight but, based on their strong recent form and the return of star players before the finals, they are being kept short in premiership betting. Bookies have them as second favourites behind the Broncos.<p /> "The first thing in Webby's mind is that he is keen to play," Cullen said. "He didn't play State of Origin this year, so he didn't play at all when we had our byes and he wants to get out there every week for his club.<p />"We think the game has always been about not getting players into the vertical in tackles like that, rather than not bringing them above the horizontal, and Webby doesn't think he has done anything wrong. He let the player go when the tackle went past the horizontal, but past cases tell you that once it goes past the horizontal it's very hard to beat the charge. So to make sure Webby can play on Friday night, it's likely we'll plead guilty."<p />The only other player charged yesterday was Bulldogs prop Mark O'Meley, who would miss suspension on a grade-one careless high tackle charge whether he pleaded guilty or was found guilty.<p />Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that Robina would be the long-term site for the Gold Coast's home ground. The new NRL team will play its inaugural season of 2007 at Carrara Stadium but will shift to a newly-developed stadium from the following year.<p />Gold Coast City Council yesterday voted to make Robina the venue, and club managing director Michael Searle said the result was the best possible one.<p />"This is great news for us and for the city," Searle said. "It means we have absolute certainty about the location of the site and that the State Government can now move to the next phase of planning and building the stadium.<p />"The stadium will only be five minutes from Burleigh Beach, which puts it on the rail line from Brisbane and also within reach of the people from the top of NSW.<p />"It will be a fully seated, 25,000-capacity stadium ... it will be a terrific venue."
