Following Ellie 's `` ridiculous '' win in the immunity challenge last night , the six non-bedroom-bound MasterChef contestants take to Times Square for a spot of looking like a rube ... or as Alana tells us to `` soak it all in '' .

In order to really emphasise the wide-eyed tourist the narration duties are passed to Ellie .
Quick cuts of time-lapse footage and lots of crash zooms convince us that this really is crazy .

Ellie tells us : `` It 's just crazy !
There are people from all walks of life ... tourists , sailors , taxi drivers '' .
In the background Billy can be seen jumping into one of the cabs that those drivers have abandoned , high-tailing it to the airport .
I guess the prospect of a week locked in a room with Sun will do that to ya .

Then the big screen -- brought to you by two very prominent sponsor names -- on Times Square fills with a pair of familiar faces .
Kate wins the group 's game of I-Spy by pointing out that it 's `` MattmoranandGeorge '' .
It 's nice to see they 're still using surnames to distinguish the Matts .
Not tall-baldy and cravat , or bow tie and hideously-ugly-blue-lapelled-dinner-suit .

MattmoranandGeorge start talking to Times Square , telling the group to listen up as Gary has an important announcement .
And by announcement they mean clich√© .

`` This is New York and New York never sleeps ... and tonight the six of you wo n't either '' says 60-foot neon Gary .
Ellie , Dani and Michael all take a small step towards Hayden .
Gary then explains they will be challenging all night to prepare a three course meal for mystery guests .

`` The next task is to select your co-worker .
Look to your right , that 's who you 're cooking with . ''
Ellie hugs the New York police officer standing next to her and asks if he has immunity too .

Kate is on Michael 's right and does n't get away in time so she explains to us that she thinks they 'll work well together .
With a few more practices she might even sound convincing .

George tells Times Square that each pair is responsible for one course , and contestants wo n't be cooking with `` one of your creations '' and Dr Frankenstein slinks away with monster in tow .

No they 'll be stealing their dishes from three of New York 's best Michelin starred chefs .
To find out who , they 'll have to follow the clues .
`` The information you seek is constantly on the move . ''

We cut to three out of work actors walking around Times Square wearing sandwich boards .
Michael tells us that everything in Times Square is on the move so this wo n't be easy as a skyscraper wanders past .

Gary tells us the name of the restaurant where we 'll be cooking and where we 'll dine -- the Four Seasons -- and to remember it .
Ellie giggles .
Then George starts of a countdown clock on the Times Square billboard and the six scatter .

Dani and Hayden start playing word games : `` taxis move '' says Hayden .
Dani starts asking strangers .
Ellie starts moving hoping that means that the clue will be on her , Alana reminds her to `` still look , still look '' .
Michael suggest to Kate that `` those guys on the bikes '' ( or rickshaws ) might be clues .
The teams are officially clueless .

Then Dani sees a lady with a sandwich board and they 're off to wd-50 to find the recipe for the entree on the Lower East Side , so they hop in a cab .

Michael and Kate dash to a second clue and are repelled , Kate by the prospect of having to cook steak frites for the main , Michael by the green apron the board-walker is holding out as he is really more of a winter palate .
They too grab a taxi .

Ellie asks a sailor and a rickshaw rider if they have a message for her .
Alana catches up though so the sailor looks a bit abashed about the clue he was about to give Ellie .
Then Alana finds the final walking clue and discovers they are off to Tribeca to make dessert .
But where is Tribeca ?
Ellie chooses this moment to stop asking taxi drivers questions , Alana takes up the mantle though yelling to Times Square `` is anyone a local New Yorker '' .
The biggest tourist destination in the world stares blankly back at her .

The clock tells us there is only 3 hours and 15 minutes remaining as the pair find a pair of ` locals ' who respond to Alana 's question `` Can we use the subway ? '' with the logic of an eight year old .
`` You may of course use the subway '' and points her in the direction of the One Train .
Silly Alana , you always follow up with `` SHOULD I use the subway ? '' to out-logic that particular pedantic quip .

Dani and Hayden in their cab are worried about the twenty minute ride their cab driver predicts .
Dani promises to give him a tip if he can get there in 10 .
The driver promises to lock the doors and drive extra slow if she does n't give him a tip .
Hayden 's thinking about that funny Pizza Hut commercial ... `` be good to ya mum '' .

Michael and Kate find David Chang 's restaurant Ma Peche .
They 've been told to go in by the service entrance .
Kate is upset about the rabbit warren they 've entered .
Michael is polishing off a small bottle with DRINK ME written on it .

They finally get to the restaurant and get told to wait for ten minutes as apparently the Michelin-starred chef has more important things to do .
Kate and Michael are stunned .
How could anyone be more imp -- we cut to Hayden and Dani who have just pulled up at wd-50 only to find that Wiley the chef they 're looking for is sick .
Dani smiles and nods .
He 's dying of an unknown virus .
Hayden smiles and nods .
John , the chef-cuisine , is so impressed with their sympathy in the face of illness that he stops what he 's doing to look after them ... just as soon as we watch a pre-edited intro video .
It 's lucky the show had that , what with Wiley 's unexpected illness and all .
They are going to make everything bagel ice cream with trout threads .
John gives them the recipe , the ingredients and kicks out the insensitive bastards .

Ellie and Alana are sitting on the subway .
A kindly New Yorker points out the train does n't go where they want to go .
Ellie listens .
Another explains to Ellie that the end of the world is nigh , so she relaxes as that means she wo n't have to finish the challenge .
Ellie asks if the locals are going her way and says she 'll follow them .
The subway car empties as everyone decides these patsies in the yellow aprons are too good a target to pass up .

Michael and Kate finally get David Chang 's attention and decide not to berate him for being so rude .
They 're making Steak Frites with the fries made from rice and a side of asparagus and crab .
He explains the dish , including the rice-fries , hands them the recipe with all the ingredients -- including rice -- and lets them try his version .
Michael admires that the chips are made of rice .
Kate tries the chip and there 's something wrong :

`` Okaaaay , so the chips are made of rice !
I probably should have guessed that ''

Which seems a little harsh , as there had n't been any clues up til then .

They 're on the road .
Dani and Hayden are on the road .
They 're all heading to Four Seasons , East 52nd Street .
The driver notes that there 's a couple of them , so they suggest going to the one on East 52nd because `` that 's what we were told '' .
Sheesh , as if anyone could forget that , Gary told them to remember it .
Can you imagine ANYONE who would do that ?

Ellie and Alana are running like `` Olympic sprinters '' once they get off the subway .
That would be Olympic muppet sprinters I take it , given the flailing arms .
They arrive at `` some random corner on some random street '' as the inhospitable subway system neglects to deliver them door-to-door .
They find the street but ca n't find number 239 .
If only the numbers were in some sort of order .
They ask two passersby where 239 is and the point it out , right there between 237 and 241 .
Honestly , only in America !

They charge in to the kitchen after attempting to enter a storage cupboard , and Ellie does n't think that anyone gets to do this .
No one without a camera crew and a producer that is .
Ellie starts begging Chef Paul for his recipe for Gold Bar dessert .
Ellie says she 's scared of the dish .
Given their blind meander through the streets of New York , it makes perfect sense that this is the first thing she 'd be frightened of .

Back in the kitchen Hayden is shocked they were back first and explains that the trout has to be cooked four ways , it 's tricky and takes a long time .
Cured , poached , fried up and then smoked , it has to be done just right -- so he 's sent Dani to count the cutlery and do some of the vital recapping of plot to camera .
George wishes him luck and sets off to find Dani .

Ellie and Alana are confident in their cab .
They 've already assigned their roles .
Their current role is to be stuck in traffic .
Finally they get to the Four Seasons .
The other Four Seasons .
The doorman refuses to let the two lunatics in yellow aprons in , presumably because he 's not a Michelin starred chef as they 've been admitting lunatics all over the city .
He suggests they go to the Four Seasons on EAST 52nd street .
Honestly , who could have seen that coming ? !

Dani stands next to the automatic gelato maker explaining how hard she 's working .
Michael explains that their chef `` hammered into them '' how important being organised was , but Michael explains that he 's too busy getting ready to be organised .

Ellie and Alana run in and try to get going , so Gary stops them both to demand `` where have you been ? ''
Alana cooks , Ellie explains , Gary says that they 're on detention and to see the headmaster after class .

Michael has had another moment of inspiration .
The recipe calls for the carrots to be peeled .
He 's not going to .
He wants to work on his crab .
Kate wants him to work on his sauce .
Thank goodness he did n't spend time getting organised .

Hayden is stirring his trout .
Dani is stirring the other contestants , because she has nothing to do .
Then the words that Australia has been waiting for , Dani tells us point blank `` there is n't an awful lot that I can do '' .
No one in the kitchen blinks at this Earth-shattering revelation .

Kate is worried about hers and Michael 's process-to-time ratio .
Matt Moran is worried about it too and tells them to make sure the steak and frites components of their Steak Frites are ready .
Michael is worried about the crabs ... so he 's ducked down the pharmacy and that 's just not helping .

Hayden is smoking the trout .
Dani is floating around trying to think up a witty play on words about smoking the trout .
As this process only takes ten minutes though , she 's going to need it all .
Hayden stops the smoking after five minutes .
Dani is mortified , she has n't made a single pun .
Hayden says the fish tastes right though which is more important .
Dani is worried he 's blown it -- oh wait there 's her pun , at least it would have been had she made it .

The three pairs are plating up .
Michael wants to do David Chang 's dish justice , so he 's sentenced himself to 300 hours of community service , as he 's left out the crab .
Ellie and Alana plate up their chocolate gold bar with `` real gold leaf '' .
Hayden thinks he and Dani have done enough to win .
Kate says the absence of the crab from their dish is glaringly obvious , so Michael erases the chalk outline of a crab that he 's drawn on every plate .
He has to rethink how to do justice to the crab that just made the ultimate sacrifice for nothing .

The chefs come out to meet their guests .
It turns out the judging panel consists of Julian Niccolini from the Four Seasons plus John from wd-50 , David from Ma Peche and Paul from Corton , the three chefs who gave them the recipes .
Hayden looks nervous , he 's not sure if he can smoke trout as well as John -- see Dani , it 's just not that hard !

Hayden and Dani present their entree to the panel of eight .
George asks John if he 's smiling .
It 's actually impressive that a man who ca n't see the expression on the face of a chef sitting less than a metre away has survived to this age what with all the sharp objects and flames .
John nods , then realises this wo n't help , so explains that the bagel ice cream is perfect , but the smoked trout tastes like dried fish .
See , it 's the subtle language of cooking that makes all the difference .

Michael and Kate serve up and worry that everyone but George will instantly see the absent crab .
David is impressed that these two rank amateurs have achieved what they have .
He says the flavours are all there .
George is just thrilled that the steak is n't overcooked , setting the bar considerably lower than the ` perfectly cooked four ways ' Hayden and Dani had to overcome .
Matt Moran asks if anyone missed the crab on the asparagus .
David shakes his head .
George stares expectantly at him waiting for an answer .

Alana and Ellie break the awkward tension with their desserts .
Paul thinks they did a `` bloody good job '' .
Julian is `` totally impressed '' .
Paul says they 're 85 % there .
George is impressed that they 've gotten `` anything up '' , lowering that benchmark once more .
He explains he 's just happy to `` see this on a plate '' and his joy is explained , his eyesight has returned .

The pairs return to the toom to have their rewards explained -- a meal and master class with Daniel Boulud -- and the cost of failure -- a cook-off with Billy and Sun .
This is the cue for a glimpse of Billy and Sun sitting in their hotel room .
Billy is sitting reading a magazine ; Sun is facing away from Billy staring in the mirror sipping on a takeaway coffee .
The tension is so thick you could cut away from it with a very rapid editing decision .

For Dani and Hayden , the ice cream flavour is perfect , but the soy and the mirin were missing from the trout thread .
Hayden explains that he was told to be light on the soy and mirin , so he was light on them .
But as it 's a dish with two heroes , he feels his dish has a protagonist based problem .

Michael and Kate are morose , they have the nailed the hero in their dish , but that was actually the job of its nemesis , crab man , so they feel their comic franchise is in danger .

Preston was just pleased to see Ellie and Alana 's smiley faces as they wheeled their desserts out .
Immediately casting the girls as damsels in distress , Alana takes up the theme by pointing out that they are just `` two little amateur chefs from Brisbane '' .
George is so impressed that they go 85 % of the way there .
He mentions the problems with the dish but Gary ca n't wait to cut him off to say there has been only one stand out winner .

That is of course the team utterly lacking in heroes , Team Dessert .
Alana is so happy she sings .
Ellie says there 's something in the water here that agrees with her .
Is n't that the alligators people flushed down the toilet ?
Gary says the eight men around the table all agreed that the girls and their dessert really stood out , and not just because it was chocolate .
What more can you ask for ?
Your dessert is so good it 's not just chocolate .

Michael and Kate are sure they are the team who came last .
What with the missing ingredient that seems reasonable .
Preston disagrees though .
Michael looks distraught .
Perhaps Katherine Feeney is right and he is worried more for Hayden than for himself .
Kate is relieved .
Hayden looks unimpressed .
Dani is frustrated but realises that at this point of the competition it comes down to slight things .
Things like missing ingredients and components ( heroes if you will ) of the dish that are too thick .
Oh wait , that was the other teams .

George explains that if it was just down to their performance in the kitchen they would have won by a landslide , but after reading the comments sections of our recaps , the producers feel they have to put Dani into the elimination so we have more material to work with .
Moran says they do n't need to look devastated as they can redefine themselves tomorrow .
Hayden starts now by redefining himself as the sort of person who talks about himself in the third person `` this is n't the end of Hayden , no way '' .

Tomorrow the not-so-fab-four head to Harlem to cook soul food .
Suddenly I try to remember if Sun actually had a reflection when she was looking in the mirror .
Does she have a soul for soul food ?

I guess we 'll find out .
