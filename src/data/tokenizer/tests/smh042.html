STRUGGLING clothing and handbag retailer OrotonGroup has hinted it could reconsider a bid from a private equity group or selling off parts of its business, one year after rejecting a takeover offer from Catalyst Investment Managers.<p />Oroton, whose share price hit a five-year low last month after it issued a profit downgrade, announced yesterday it would conduct a strategic review that would "examine all the strategic options available" to the group.<p />The company said it had appointed the independent investment bank Carnegie Wylie to "assess the strategic and financial impact of the various options and to advise on a course of action".<p />Oroton managing director Ross Lane declined to specify what options the company was looking at. Mr Lane would only say the review would look at "various paths the group can go down in attracting shareholder value". He declined to rule out attracting an offer from a private equity group.<p />"There's a lot of possibilities and at this stage I'm not prepared to discuss any of the individual possibilities," he said.<p />Mr Lane said the review was "related to the value of the company and the value of the assets we have in the company".<p />Oroton shares rose 6c to $1.29 yesterday but have fallen $2.01 from their 2003 high. <p />Mr Lane, whose family has a 53 per cent stake in the company, said he had no regrets rejecting the offer from Catalyst last year, which is believed to have been at double Oroton's current price.<p />"The offer at the time wasn't acceptable and we don't think our shareholders would have accepted it," Mr Lane said. He said the bid was overly conditional yet still declined to say how much it was worth. It is rumoured the bid was valued at around $2.50 a share.<p />The group's troubles have largely stemmed from the Marcs retail chain it purchased for $22 million three years ago. <p />Oroton plans to relaunch the Marcs brand next month, which Mr Lane said would involve a "new tone of voice".<p />He said the new Marcs would have lower price points and a "colour palette more relevant to Australian consumers". He conceded the recent colour range of purples offered in Marcs' winter catalogues was "not appropriate for men".<p />Last month, the company said its Polo and Morrissey brands also performed poorly.
