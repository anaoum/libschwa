The two inevitabilities in life , death and taxes , when combined can have disastrous consequences for the unprepared .
From an income tax point of view , where appropriate steps have not been taken , the impact of the death on a superannuation fund member can result in large amounts of tax payable when the superannuation passes to non-dependent beneficiaries .

When one of the trustees of a self-managed super fund ( SMSF ) dies , steps must be taken by the surviving trustee to ensure the fund can continue .
This can involve having another member / trustee join the fund , appoint a company to act as trustee , or convert the fund to a small APRA fund .

Q You wrote if the members of a super fund are the trustees and one of them dies , a new member and trustee must join the fund .
If this cannot happen , one option is conversion to a small APRA fund .
What is a small APRA fund and can it operate with one member / trustee ?

A Small APRA funds are those that have fewer than five members , which do not qualify as an SMSF , and have an approved trustee .
In this situation a fund can only have one member / trustee .
Approved trustees tend mainly to be large companies acting as trustees .
They often also act as executors of deceased estates .

Being large companies that make their money acting as trustees , this often can be a very expensive alternative .
In addition , a member can end up being bogged down in a lot of bureaucracy and restricted in the investments their fund can make .

Q I have an allocated super pension with the residual beneficiaries of my estate being non-dependents who live in Britain and the US .
Will the estate have to pay the death benefits tax ?

A It would appear that the simplest solution will be if your estate did pay the 15 per cent tax that applies to superannuation paid to non-dependents .
Once this was done , the net funds could then be distributed to the beneficiaries living in Britain and the US .
If this was not done , tax would still be payable and the beneficiaries could be forced to submit an Australian tax return that would result in the same amount of tax being paid .

Q I am originally from Iran .
My parents died about two years ago and their house has now been sold and my share of the property is a reasonable amount that I wish to transfer to Australia .
Do I need to do some preliminary paperwork or seek permission in Australia before transferring the funds and will there be any tax levied on this money ?

A I do not know of any permission needed to transfer the money into Australia .
You should check with the bank in Iran and your bank in Australia to see what must be done before transferring the money .

As you are receiving the inheritance as a cash distribution from your parents ' estate , there should be no tax payable on the funds you will be transferring .
If it takes some time to organise the transfer , and you earn interest on the money in Iran during that time , you will need to declare that interest on your tax return .

Although the money you are receiving will not be taxable , make sure you have documentation that clearly shows the funds have come from your parents ' estate .
This is because the ATO receives information about large amounts of money transferred from overseas and it will ask for an explanation as to where the funds came from .
