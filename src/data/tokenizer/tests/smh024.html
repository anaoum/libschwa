Financial planners are recommending that their clients choose investments that result in a commission to the planner of more than 10 per cent.<p />Is this bad? For everyone - the investor, the investment fund manager paying the commission, and even the planner - it is extremely bad.<p />It is something of a small wonder commissions at these levels are still being paid to planners, after the Westpoint property group collapse.<p />And not just because investors are in effect paying 10 cents of their investment dollar into the pocket of a financial planner.<p />Up-front planner commissions for selling most investment products are in the range of 1 per cent to 2 per cent.<p />Westpoint's success in obtaining funds for its shaky property-and-loans empire - it collapsed in 2005 owing $300 million - was partly based on high commissions for financial planners.<p />This point cannot be argued. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has banned 15 financial planners who breached their duties when they advised their clientsthey should invest in Westpoint-related entities.<p />And one of the reasons planners breached their duties was the influence of higher commissions for them rather than recommending the appropriate investment for the investor.<p />Westpoint highlighted the dangers of a commission-based payment system for financial planners.<p />They are the kinds of dangers that have prompted National Australia Bank's financial planning businesses - its in-house planning network, and Garvan - to move to a fee-for-advice financial planning model rather than rely on commission-based payments.<p />But back to those investment groups that are still paying 10 per cent-plus commissions to financial planners. The agri-business sector is ripe with tax deductibility as it offers various "flavours" of tax-effective schemes.<p />Investors put their money into anything from olive groves to eucalypt forests, and hope like hell the Australian Taxation Office does not rethink the product rulings the investments rely on for their tax-deductible status.<p />Across the sector, 10 per cent commissions for financial planners who "sell" the products are the norm rather than the exception.<p />In a small sample of product disclosure statements, Barossa Vines' Project 2007 paid up to 10 per cent or $400 to planners for every $4000 invested. Macquarie Group's Almond Investment 2007 pays an upfront commission of up to 12 per cent. In the 78-page product disclosure statement for the 2007-08 Timbercorp Timberlot Project, commissions are described on page 66 as 5 per cent up front commission plus 5 per cent for the planning group's costs in marketing the project.<p />Apart from commissions, there are other signs of the potential influence agribusiness schemes are exerting on financial planners.<p />This is demonstrated by the sponsorship dollars gained by Professional Investment Services, the country's biggest network of financial planners, with more than 1400 licensed financial planners.<p />PIS, which is bigger than AMP's financial planning business, held a conference in Las Vegas attended by 720 planners. PIS's register of alternative remuneration, which records "soft dollar" commissions from various fund managers, shows it raised $547,500 in sponsorships from a broad range of 43 different fund managers.<p />Within the total sponsorship, about $110,000 was provided by eight different agribusiness scheme promoters.<p />They are hardly household names, and include FEA Plantations, Barossa Vines, Brooklyn Park Organic Olive Grove, Almond Investors and Willmott Forests. <p />In other words, 20c in every $1 of conference sponsorship was received from agribusiness promoters. On any measure a 20 per cent level of agribusiness sponsorship is wildly disproportionate to the importance of agribusiness as an investment class.<p />An estimated $7 billion has been invested in agri-business schemes within the past seven years. This figure represents 0.6 per cent of the $1.14 trillion now invested in the ASX 200.<p />The high level of sponsorship from agribusiness promoters is partly explained by PIS's roots among accountants dealing with clients' tax issues. But PIS has no fixed position on whether individual planners should take the full 10 per cent for selling these products.<p />It is too easy to get to a picture of big commissions, cosy sponsorships and real potential for influence. One question is: why do planner groups let themselves and their planners get into this situation? Well, some don't. A Melbourne planner, National Financial Solutions, also pays back to investors up front commissions of up to 8 per cent of the investment, and takes a much smaller fee up front.<p />OK, so financial planners need to be paid. But a 10 per cent commission on any investment? Give me a break.<p />Planning groups and planners that recognise and attempt to address the clear conflicts from higher-commission products are a step ahead of the game. <p />The ones that don't are on a slippery slope that ends in a breach of the duty they owe to their investor clients.
