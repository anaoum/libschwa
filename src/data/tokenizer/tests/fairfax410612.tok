Devising the best way to spruik a business is half the battle these days , as Nina Hendy reports .

As the list of marketing options grows to include social networking , email marketing and whisper campaigns , small- and medium-size businesses must have a solid marketing strategy .

But the truth is that more than half of them in Australia do n't bother .
A recent survey by business-management company Access Management Corporation found 58.9 per cent of small-business owners do n't prepare an annual marketing strategy or attempt to identify the benefit and cost of marketing .
This could be why the failure rate of small businesses is so high in the first year .

The director of Marketing Elements , Cecelia Haddad , is not surprised by the research .

`` A lot of businesses do n't put much thought into a marketing plan and as a result , it 's often done ad hoc , '' she says .
`` Businesses need to realise that marketing is n't an expense but a legitimate business-building activity . ''

But a lot of small businesses do n't know how to develop a marketing strategy .

`` Often they will try a marketing technique based on their own ideas or what may seem like a bargain only to realise it only reached a small percentage of their target market , by which time their budget is blown , '' she says .

A marketing plan should look at how a business will promote itself to its target audience , usually over a 12-month period .

Haddad says a marketing plan should include a detailed budget and examine the best ways to promote the business .

`` You want [ it ] to take in analysis of your competitors and to have specific goals , '' she says .
`` It also needs to break down how much you 've set aside for marketing , how you 're going to spend it , look at who your target audience is and how you tackle internal and external communications . ''

A marketing plan for a small business might be only a few pages long but larger businesses often require a more-detailed plan .

The plan needs to be revisited monthly -- or , at the very least , quarterly , Haddad says .

Business owners can write their own plan or hire an expert , which would cost $ 1000 to $ 7000 , depending on the size of the business and who is used .

Zadro Communications recently created Comm*Bat , which helps businesses determine marketing priorities for 12 months .

Managing director Felicity Zadro says small to medium businesses often find marketing plans intimidating and expensive .

`` We found that companies are either too busy to stop and write a marketing strategy or simply do n't place enough value on having a plan in place , '' she says .

The founder of storage business Fiona Kate , Fiona Chandler , changes her marketing strategy each year .
`` At first it was geared toward PR but we 've grown our marketing as we can afford to and now also include writing articles about storage and have created a blog , '' Chandler says .
