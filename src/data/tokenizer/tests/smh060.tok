The Office

UK-TV , 8.30 pm

Before the wry smiles , this ground-breaking series makes us cringe for David Brent , London regional manager of paper merchant Wernham Hogg .
Marvellously played by his creator , Ricky Gervais , Brent perpetrates a stream of unwittingly cruel and sexist jokes , many of them directed at his receptionist Dawn ( Lucy Davis ) .
This pathetic jokemeister seeks popularity by hovering over his staff , so the show makes welcome escapes into a corner where Gareth , the office creep ( Mackenzie Crook ) , is at loggerheads with Tim ( Martin Freeman ) .

Yours for a Song

Ovation , 7.30 pm

Great songwriters of the old century ?
Cole Porter , Irving Berlin , certainly , but consider A Fine Romance , The Way You Look Tonight , Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall and In a Little Spanish Town .
All standards and all written by women .
A delightful , surprising documentary .

Everyone 's a Psychic
