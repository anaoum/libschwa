<p>Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has launched a royal commission-style inquiry into the state's devastating and deadly floods.</p>
<p>The $15 million inquiry, to be headed by Justice Cate Holmes, will examine the disaster, government preparedness and the emergency response.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said the operation of dams, including the adequacy of water releases from Wivenhoe, would be among <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/queenslands-flood-inquiry-the-terms-of-reference-20110117-19tv7.html"><strong>issues investigated</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh announced the commission of inquiry this afternoon after confirming the death toll from the floods had risen to 20, with another body discovered at Grantham.</p>
<p>A death in a vehicle in Ipswich last week had also been deemed flood related. More than 10 people were still missing.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said she expected the inquiry team to visit the towns and cities inundated by the floods so that local people could attend hearings and give evidence.</p>
<p>The independent inquiry would have the powers of a royal commission including the ability to summon witnesses, require documents to be produced, and issue search warrants, she said.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said she would be prepared to attend the inquiry if called to give evidence and the public should be confident the government was "not going to sweep anything under the carpet".</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/weather/queenslands-flood-inquiry-the-terms-of-reference-20110117-19tv7.html"><strong>terms of reference</strong></a> require the inquiry to examine the adequacy of forecasts and early warning systems, particularly regarding the flooding in Toowoomba and the Lockyer and Brisbane valleys.</p>
<p>The preparation and planning by federal, state and local governments and emergency services will also come under the spotlight.</p>
<p>Ms Bligh also wants the inquiry to report on the operation of dams across the state, including the release strategies from the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams, and whether flood mitigation was appropriate.</p>
<p>The inquiry will also investigate land use planning and development in flood-prone areas and the performance of private insurers in fulfilling claims</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said the disaster needed to be examined thoroughly.</p>
<p>"The last three weeks have been truly shocking for all Queenslanders and now is the time to forensically examine the devastating chain of events and the aftermath," Ms Bligh said.</p>
<p>The head of the new inquiry, Justice Holmes, is a sitting Supreme Court judge and was   counsel assisting the Forde Royal Commission into child abuse in 1998.</p>
<p>She will be assisted by two deputy commissioners, former  Queensland  police commissioner Jim O'Sullivan, and the chairman of the   International Commission on Large Dams, Phil Cummins.</p>
<p>"Our government has appointed three highly respected people to undertake that task and I want to honour those people who have lost their lives through this disaster by ensuring all possible lessons are learnt," Ms Bligh said.</p>
<p>The initial budget for the inquiry would be $15 million, Ms Bligh said.</p>
<p>"I know that sounds like a lot of money but this is an investment in our future safety," she said.</p>
<p>An interim report on flood preparedness issues is due by August 1 this year so they can be implemented before next summer's wet season.</p>
<p>The final report is due by January 17 next year.</p>
