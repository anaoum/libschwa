<p>There was plenty for Australian investors at the latest Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Early on, Warren Buffett mentioned that Berkshire had made about $100 million last year in just two currencies - and the Australian dollar was one of them.</p><p>
That much was reported by several media outlets following the meeting. But arguably the most interesting comment came next. Buffett said the Australian dollar could be in for a huge movement, ''and it could be quite dramatic in either direction. I don't know which.'' He said that was why Berkshire no longer had a large bet.''</p><p>
That's quite a statement from a man whose tendency is to say less rather than more on such matters (Buffett typically prefers to stick with sharemarket and general business matters). Yet say it he did.</p><p>
The vice-chairman of Berkshire, Charlie Munger, then added an open-ended comment to Buffett's remarks: ''Australia has these fabulous open-pit mines, which [is great] when Asia is booming.'' And perhaps not so great when it isn't.</p><p>
If Asia's development continues apace and the US keeps printing money, another billionaire investor, Jim Rogers, may be right. He has suggested the Australian dollar could reach $US1.40.</p><p /><h3><b>Three categories</b></h3><p>
Yet it's easy enough to see the downside. China could stumble, or our property prices might fall dramatically. Either of those eventualities would likely see the Australian dollar weaken markedly.</p><p>
Buffett also weighed in on another topic close to Australian hearts - commodities  - after one shareholder complained that Berkshire's share price had barely kept pace with inflation since his purchase in 2006, while his gold holdings had performed spectacularly.</p><p>
At the hundreds of annual meetings I've attended, such questions are typically met by corporate bluster or defensive posturing. But Buffett is several cuts above the average. He took the opportunity to point out that when he took over Berkshire, its share price was equivalent to three-quarters of an ounce of gold. ''So gold - even at $US1500 ($1400)- still has a way to go'', he said, implying a comparison with Berkshire Hathaway's price of more than $US120,000 and tacitly emphasising a longer-term perspective.</p><p>
He could have left the topic there but, instead, delivered a lecture on what he saw as the three categories of investments.</p><p /><h3><b>Gold is useless</b></h3><p>
The first is anything denominated in a currency, such as cash, bonds or current accounts. ''Any currency-related investment is a bet on how the government will behave in future,'' Buffett said, citing Zimbabwe as an example.</p><p>
The second category of investments are ''items you buy that don't produce anything but that you hope someone will pay you more for later on''. He then spoke at length about the uselessness of gold.</p><p>
Buffett said that if all the gold ever mined were melted into a single cube, it would be about 20 metres on each side and weigh about 165,000 to 167,000 tonnes. ''You could climb on it, fondle it, polish it, stare at it. But it isn't going to do anything. You're hoping someone will buy it from you later on.''</p><p>
The third category is productive assets. These are assets about which you can make a rational calculation and measure whether their performance over time matches your initial expectations. Buffett advised that, over time, speculating in commodities has not been the way to get rich. Owning good businesses has been.</p><p /><h3><b>Productive assets</b></h3><p>
The mini-lecture closed with a powerful illustration. Buffett said the sum total of gold ever mined, at today's price, is worth about $US8 trillion.</p><p>
He invited the audience to consider what else that amount of money could buy: all of the farmland in the lower 48 US states (estimated at $US2 trillion), 10 ExxonMobils (it boasts a market value of more than $US400 billion) and you could ''stick a trillion in your pocket for walking-around money''.</p><p>
While admitting to past investments in oil (at $US10 a barrel) and silver (which has industrial uses), Buffett took several other opportunities to underline his preference for investing in productive assets over non-productive ones.</p><p>
At a time when everyone's eyes are on commodity prices, such clear-headed explanations are more than useful and deserve all the more weight when  they come from a man who has built a $US50 billion fortune.</p><p>
