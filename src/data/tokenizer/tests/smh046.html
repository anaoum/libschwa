Books have taken centre stage in the actress's life.<p />Jane Clifton is worried the Tax Office will not believe her 2005-06 tax return. When she spoke to Money, on the last day of the financial year, she was confident her taxable income would be $11,000, but the actress, singer, comedian, broadcaster, author, talking book narrator and occasional quiz mistress is not complaining. <p />After 35 years in show business, she's used to its feast-or-famine nature. The previous year, for example, she describes as a "bumper year", when she starred in Menopause the Musical and released her second comic thriller novel, A Hand in the Bush.<p />"I'm either shopping at Ikea or scrabbling on the floor of the car for petrol money," laughs Clifton, 57, emphasising that shopping at Ikea means she feels rich. Her previous bumper year was 1999, when income from a series of ads for the Sussan clothing chain helped finance her debut solo CD, The Marriage of Style.<p />"I had the classic phone call recently, with the hounds barking at the door of penury, about an ad that would have paid $15,000." She's heard no more. Clifton says it's her partner of 25 years, musician Paul Williamson, who keeps the roof over the family's head.<p />The one thing that does get up Clifton's nose is not being paid for the thousands and thousands of repeat showings of jailhouse soapie Prisoner, which is still being broadcast in Britain and has been released as a boxed DVD set.<p />Clifton says Prisoner, in which she played bank robber Margo Gaffney, was one of the last shows not to pay its cast for repeats.<p />"When we were signing up we were happy to be working," says Clifton, whose three-year role ended in 1984. "If we'd received the royalties, I really wouldn't have to work again."<p />Does the public still ask her about Prisoner? "Every single day of my life, everywhere I go," she says. Clifton has just returned from a tour of regional libraries in Victorian, talking about writing - and every day, without fail, an audience member would ask her to sign a Prisoner DVD boxed set. <p />"My photo is even on the cover of one [disc]."<p />Clifton describes herself as "gainlessly unemployed" in television and theatre at present, although she has just started a new gig on Mondays at Hardimans Hotel in Melbourne, singing, chatting and interviewing guests.<p />Her main focus now is writing, following the success of her debut novel, Half Past Dead, in 2002. She's working on her third novel, which she describes as "a dark story with an edge of wry humour".<p />As to why someone who already has many strings to her bow would launch a new career in her 50s, Clifton says: "Like everything else in my long career, it's been following what I like doing."<p /><p />THE BIG QUESTIONS <p />Biggest break It would have to be playing Margo in Prisoner, in terms of public recognition. <p />Biggest achievement My two children [Molly-Rose, 18, and Hank, 14] and, secondly, my books.<p />Biggest regret That I didn?t become a lawyer. I love a wig and I love an argument, and I really like a good car [she drives a 1991 Nissan Pintara].<p />Best investment I don?t have any investments. I did buy some shares once, on a tip from my hairdresser, and it was so hair-raising it taught me not to do it again.<p />Worst investment In 1998 I paid $8000 for an ?86 Volvo; the most expensive car I?d ever bought. But you have to have an income to run a Volvo and I sold it in 2004 because I couldn?t afford the registration. I got $150 for it. I sometimes see the same model and my heart flutters.<p />Attitude to money I?m really good at lots of things, but I?ve never been good at ballet or making money. [ABC Melbourne radio host] Red Symons once said to me, very early in our friendship, ?You?ll never be rich? and it was like pointing the bone.<p />Biggest indulgence It used to be shoes. I have hundreds of pairs, I never throw them out. Now, it?s probably manchester; I do love sheets. If you can?t change your life you can change your manchester.
