Michael Diamond has fished himself out of `` the hard times '' and is setting out on the road to Athens , and Dawn Fraser 's record , writes Jessica Halloran .

Laughter rolls out of Johnny Boxer 's mouth as he anticipates the day to come on his mate Michael Diamond 's boat , Pump Action .
He says he 's going to jump off and go swimming starkers in Botany Bay .

`` It 's hot , hey , got a T-shirt for me to wear , Dicky Knee ? '' says Boxer , beer and fag seemingly stapled to his tattooed left hand .

Dicky Knee that 's Diamond shakes his head with a knowing smile and chuckles as he throws Boxer a daisy-yellow T-shirt .

Diamond , who has already won two Olympic gold medals but wants a third to equal `` Dawn 's record '' and honour his late father , Constantine , cranks up the booming engines of his 40 footer , diesel clouds puffing into the sunshine .

`` Smokin' , '' barks Boxer .

There are fewer than 100 days to go before the Games begin in the heat of Athens .
It 's `` incredible '' that these Games are so close says Diamond , remembering the Sydney Olympics as though they were yesterday .

`` All of a sudden , it 's 2004 . ''

Diamond , slick mirrored glass shielding his eyes , loads beer onto the boat .
The Sutherland Shire waters are glassy and it 's a lovely autumn day for boating , drinking and fishing .
Ah , the life of a shooter .

`` Dicky Knee ?
He 's elated , the guy could n't be happier , everything is behind him and he 's got one road in front of him , '' Boxer says , then pauses for effect .
`` ... the road to Athens . ''

The stereo has `` a shitload of music '' on it and the tunes start pumping on Pump Action .
Acts such as Usher and Jamelia blare out , the lyrics bursting out of the speakers , `` F--- you , you bitch , I do n't want you back '' , as the boat moves out to the bay .

The movie Anger Management is playing on the boat 's DVD .
No one on board has any pending appointments John the `` boat maintainer '' , Diamond 's friends Ben and Robbie , his nephew Matthew and , of course , Boxer , the former Kings Cross bouncer who stars as Bobo in Fat Pizza .
They all twist the tops off their stubbies as Pump Action moves under the Captain Cook bridge .

`` This is great , this is why life is great , brother , '' Diamond says .

Men are `` brothers '' .
Women ?
Usually `` chicken '' or `` darl '' .

Diamond sips his beer .
His mobile phone `` cock-a-doodle-dos '' , as it does throughout the day .
He has `` a lot of friends '' .

Fishing rods and nets are crammed into every nook of the galley and deck , and someone remarks that it 's a good day to drop a line .
Later , a school of mackerel ruffles the sea surface and the boys get their fishing rods out , snaring three .
Diamond loves fishing , says it 's helped him through the `` hard times '' .

`` I do a lot of deep-sea fishing , '' he says .
`` That 's nearly every weekend when the season 's on .
That 's probably the most relaxing thing .
On the boat , on the water , you feel like you are leaving everything behind on land .
Including some of your problems to do with sport and stuff and all that sort of thing that you completely forget about . ''

When he says `` hard times '' , he means the court case involving his former partner , Tracey Kennedy .
He was charged with assault after an incident in a Queanbeyan bowling club car park following an 80th birthday party .
Kennedy alleged Diamond slapped and punched her and pulled her hair .
He told the court he was kicked in the testicles by Kennedy .
He told her it was just a `` pussy kick '' and she then ran her fingernails across his eyes .

He was found not guilty .

While the assault charge was being heard he had his gun licence suspended and missed a crucial qualifying event for the Olympic trap shooting team .
The Australian Shooting Association subsequently granted Diamond a shoot-off against Nathan Cassells for a spot on the Olympic team .
Diamond won but Cassells then appealed against his Olympic selection , and a hearing will be held at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Tuesday to decide who competes in Athens .

Diamond now says he felt betrayed by Kennedy and that changed his view on life .

`` The hard times we 've gone through really were n't called for , '' he says .
`` Relationships should n't be that hard , at all .
But there are people out there that will do it , and that 's unfortunate .
That 's life . ''

When Boxer speaks about the uneasy few months , he talks of Diamond 's coolness , pronounced `` kewelness '' , under `` media , personal , relationship '' pressure .

`` He had the whole world lookin' at him ! '' Boxer says .
`` The guy came out smelling like a rose . ''

Diamond points the boat in the direction of Sylvania Waters , the `` extreme waterfront '' , to a house that is obscured , where he grew up as a kid .

`` I want to try and buy it back one day , '' he says .
`` In 1972 , my dad bought the land for 40,000 and built the house for 20,000 .
It 's now worth 2.5 million . ''

His father gave him an air rifle when he was six .
So , just as Bradman used a cricket stump and a golf ball against a corrugated iron water tank , Diamond shot at swinging cans hanging off coathangers on trees to perfect his hand-eye co-ordination .

This helped , but his father , his mentor , his coach , is the reason he is so successful .
Constantine died in May of 2000 .
Diamond speaks fondly of him and his advice .

`` There could have been more than two or three thousand times in my career when my dad was alive when I could have pulled the pin , because as a young man all I wanted to do was nightclub , '' he says .
`` He stopped me from doing that , taught me discipline .
I could have pulled the pin that many times because I did n't want to be that dedicated . ''

In Atlanta in 1996 his father called , calmed his son 's nerves : `` Do n't worry , son , it 's natural to feel scared , '' Constantine said .
`` You can do it , just block that nervous side out . ''

Diamond did and won his first gold .
And if he wins his third , he 'll dedicate it to his father .

`` His most valuable words that he told ever me were , ` Do n't move your gun before you see your target ' .
When you are ready to make a move on your target , get it aggressively , do n't be on the back foot , always lead with your front foot . '
They 're probably the most valuable words that he said to me , and I hung on to , right up until now , and I 'll probably take it to the grave with me .

`` All I am going to do is take Dad 's advice again , because that worked the first time .
First time is not different to the third time . ''

The boat heads toward the third runway of Sydney Airport , jumbos are punching through the white-blue sky and the dolphins are playing in the shimmering water .

`` I 've never seen that before in my life , '' Diamond says .
`` How unreal is that ? ''

Diamond points out a spot where he goes scuba diving and snorkelling .
This is when Boxer makes jokes about `` patting white pointers '' , taming them and wrestling them , and Diamond doing the same .

But there are no sharks , and , thank goodness , none of the `` 60 foot '' waves Diamond says the boat has pounded through before , with everyone on board signing crosses and crying `` Hail Marys '' .

`` No dramas on the Bahamas , '' Diamond says .

His voicemail message is all reggae beats and an instruction to `` leave a message , mon '' .
It 's this cruisy kind of coolness Diamond promotes about himself .
Perhaps it 's his `` easygoing '' nature that keeps him poised under pressure .

So what does it take be the world 's best ?

`` I know I 'm as good as the best .
I 've just got to follow the correct steps and do everything right and I can beat him .
I can be there , '' he says .

`` I am dealing with the pressure all the time .
It seems to get harder as I get older , pressure when you 're shooting , when the heat 's on , and you 've got a lot riding on your shoulders the pressure is significant .
It 's very easy to be distracted , that 's where the biggest battle comes in ... once you do let distraction in , it 's all over .
And it does n't take much . ''

Diamond says he 'd like to go to the next three Olympics , that there are no use-by dates for shooters .
He 'd like to equal Fraser 's record of winning three golds in the same event at three Olympics .

`` Is n't she a wonderful figure ? '' he says .
`` Absolutely wonderful sporting figure .
To be even close to being able to match a record such as Dawn 's .
Even if I have won [ only ] two in a row , it 's nice to have come second to her . ''
