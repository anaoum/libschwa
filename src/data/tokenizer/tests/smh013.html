<p>Brisbane rental prices are set to surge as thousands of displaced flood victims rush to find accommodation, market analysts say.</p>
<p>Demand for rental properties close to flood-affected suburbs could soar in coming months and push prices up 10 per cent.</p>
<p>“It's a simple matter of supply and demand,” Cameron Kusher of RP Data said.</p>
<p>“It's not unlikely for rents to increase 10 per cent as a result.”</p>
<p>The demand for furnished properties close to the CBD will be even higher, he said, although such houses and units typically account for just 5 per cent of the market.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://images.brisbanetimes.com.au/file/2011/01/18/2139435/Brisbane%20rents%202011.pdf?rand=1295319215739"><strong>median weekly rent in greater Brisbane</strong></a> in the three months to December last year was $365 for houses and $350 for units.</p>
<p>Reports have already emerged of landlords in suburbs closest to the flood zone are now asking for more than $400 per week.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately there is not a lot of scope for tenants to negotiate,” Mr Kusher said.</p>
<p>Those fortunate enough to have adequate flood insurance may be able to claim their rent costs.</p>
<p>Vacant properties could absorb the initial influx of flood victims, but the vacancy rate in Brisbane remained less than 5 per cent last year, according to RP Data.</p>
<p>Mr Kusher said displaced flood victims would need to compete for rental properties against the traditional influx of university students at this time of year.</p>
<p>“It couldn't have happened at a worse time,” he said.</p>
<p>“Flood victims can only stay with family and friends for so long. When they realise the repair of their home will take up to 12 months in some cases they will need to look for rental accommodation and often they will be forced to take whatever they can find.”</p>
<p>Dan Molloy of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland said tradespeople, who moved to Brisbane to assist in the rebuilding effort, would also place demand on the rental market.</p>
<p>“We will see acceleration in what was already a tightening market, putting upward pressure on prices,” he said.</p>
<p>“I suspect the rental squeeze will be more prominent in Ipswich because of the number of homes that were inundated.”</p>
<p>He said displaced victims in the city could look to Logan or the Gold Coast, where there would be less demand for rental properties, due to the relative ease of travelling via the motorway.</p>
<p>Most concerning was the long-term impact on the rental market.</p>
<p>“This is not a short-term phenomenon,” Mr Molloy said.</p>
<p>Simon Waide of Rental Express said the property manager had employed three extra staff to deal specifically with the rise of applications for rental properties in the coming months.</p>
<p>“It will be a case of first in, first served, because we are looking to have same-day approval due to the demand,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is traditionally the busiest time of year in the rental market with the start of school and university.”</p>
<p>Mr Waide warned landlords about being opportunistic now, for the sake of a long-term investment.</p>
<p>“It will not be favourably looked upon in the future,” he said.</p>
