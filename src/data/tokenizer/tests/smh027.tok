They filed in , some in the hijab , others wearing the yarmulka .
There were Buddhist robes , the white and red tunic of the Zoroastrians , a young Hindu man and his revered Mataji , or Reverend Mother .
All sat quietly in the golden sandstone embrace of St Mary 's Chapter House beneath enormous , gilt-framed portraits of Sydney 's past cardinals .

By the time Pope Benedict XVI left to have lunch with a group of pilgrims at the cathedral next door , the world 's great religions seemed at one , if only for an hour .

Sydney had once again turned on her brilliant sunshine , the bright light a perfect backdrop for so many enlightened words .

`` Faith is a teacher , a healer and a wellspring of peace , '' said Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence , of Sydney 's Great Synagogue .

`` Let us replace the fundamentalism of hate with the fundamentalism of love , '' responded Sheik Mohamadu Saleem , an executive member of the Australian Imams Council .

Both leaders spoke thoughtfully about the similarities between belief rather than the divisions .

`` Last week I was honoured to accept an olive plant from a young Christian student ... this symbolism is significant for all to understand and appreciate that peace is one of the noblest ideals in Islam , '' Sheik Saleem said .

`` Muslims should become more inclusive and universal in their understanding of their religion ... at the same time , significant segments of the Christian and other religious communities should overcome their misconceptions and prejudices of Islam . ''

Rabbi Lawrence spoke of all faiths ' common concern for the environment and for social justice .

`` For the sake of humanity , we must turn the strangers in our neighbours into our neighbours and our neighbours into friends . ''

The Pope , looking more meditative than during his high-octane harbour appearance on Thursday , listened attentively to Rabbi Lawrence and Sheik Saleem .

But when he took the lectern , his message was clear : religion is the way that humanity must come to understand that personal fulfilment does not lie with `` selfish gratification of ephemeral desires '' .

`` [ Religions ] teach people that authentic service requires sacrifice and self-discipline , which in turn must be cultivated through self-denial , temperance and a moderate use of the world 's goods .

`` In this way , men and women are led to regard the environment as a marvel to be pondered and respected rather than a commodity for mere consumption .

`` More importantly , [ religion ] arouses within the human spirit a thirst for truth and a hunger for virtue , '' he said .

`` May we encourage everyone , especially the young , to marvel at the beauty of life , to seek its ultimate meaning , and to strive to realise its sublime potential . ''
