JONAH Lomu is in the squad. Not the All Blacks squad for Saturday's Tri Nations clash with South Africa, although with coach Graham Henry's rotation policy again in full swing, it might be only a matter of time.<p />Lomu, 31, who last played for the All Blacks in 2002, has been picked in North Harbour's NPC squad after a single return match in club rugby last weekend.<p />The All Blacks yesterday made eight changes to their starting line-up to face the Springboks.<p />Reuben Thorne takes over from Jerry Collins at blindside breakaway, Ali Williams replaces Jason Eaton in the second row, Anton Oliver and Piri Weepu will start at hooker and halfback respectively, Sam Tuitupou replaces Aaron Mauger at inside-centre, Doug Howlett and Scott Hamilton are the new wingers, and Neemia Tialata is at loosehead prop.
