The buyers ' strike of Australian property sought by a tax reform group last month has proven to be a fizzer , precisely because some people do n't like the idea of lower house prices .

Online activist group GetUp decided not to pursue a strike of home purchases to protest the lack of affordability in the housing market because its own members did n't like the idea .

`` While the issue of housing affordability is clearly an issue that resonates with plenty of people , GetUp members do n't support a boycott campaign , '' wrote Kelsey Cooke , online community coordinator for GetUp late last week .

`` Over the course of the last couple of weeks , we surveyed a random segment of our membership to gauge support -- only 10 per cent strongly support the campaign , and more than half the surveyed members opposed this campaign altogether . ''

But with home prices wilting , auction clearance rates sinking and a wave of housing stock flooding the market , a strike on home purchases would make placards and bullhorns at Saturday morning auctions irrelevant , one analyst said .

In the year to April , the stock of houses and units coming on the market has jumped 69 per cent to 367,500 properties , according to property analysis group SQM Research .
Over the same period , the flood of stock available in Melbourne has soared 105 per cent to 43,500 .
In Sydney , the number rose a more moderate 54 per cent to 33,400 .

With those kinds of numbers , SQM managing director Louis Christopher said a buyers ' strike was unnecessary .

`` There is definitely a decline occurring , '' he said , blaming 2010's four interest rates rises which have pushed up the average rate for a home loan to about 7 per cent .

`` That 's too much for many home buyers and would-be home buyers , '' said Mr Christopher .
`` The reason 7 per cent is too much is because of our highly geared market . ''

RP Data Rismark said the national city median dwelling price was $ 455,000 in March .

First home buyers have stepped back since the end of the boost to the First Home Owners Grant in 2010 .
The share of first-time home buyers had dropped to 14.9 per cent in February , the lowest ratio since June 2004 , and just half of the peak of 28.5 per cent in May 2009 when the federal government offered incentives to draw in first-time buyers .

National home prices on a quarterly basis sank 2.1 per cent in the March quarter -- the biggest decline since RP Data Rismark began collecting the data in June 1999 .

Mr Christopher predicts the market will fall 5 to 10 per cent over the next year and half , on the official Australian Bureau of Statistics measure .

By some measures , auction clearance rates have fallen into the low 50 per cent range in Melbourne and Sydney in 2011 , well down from the highs of 80 per cent last year , during a period of historically low interest rates and the after-effects of the governments First Home Owner Grant boost brought in during the financial crisis .

To date , Melbourne 's auction listings for May have averaged 683 per weekend , up 24 per cent on the 20-year average for the month , the Real Estate Institute of Victoria said .

`` Due to the high volume of auctions and cautious market there will be a lot of negotiating when vendors ' price expectations are not realized , as has been the case with two out of five auctions this year , '' said REIV spokesman Robert Larocca .

Lending for housing increased at 6.6 per cent in the year to March , the smallest gain in the history of the RBA data series , which began in 1976 , according to data released by the Reserve Bank last week .

The home buyers ' strike , the brainchild of Prosper Australia , a little-known group that supports tax reform on land , garnered 7000 votes on the GetUp campaign forum , rocketing to the top of the list of proposed issues after it was introduced in mid-March .

GetUp 's decision not to pursue the campaign was unsurprising , said Prosper 's David Collyer .

`` The Buyers Strike is a call for direct economic action ; GetUp is a lobbying / political campaigning site , '' he said .

`` They rarely lobby for economic change , instead push for issues that struggle for funding .
One day it will be recognised that economics is central to all such issues . ''
