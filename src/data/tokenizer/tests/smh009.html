<p>A NEW supercar goes on sale in Australia this week, but owning one won't cost you a single visit to the petrol station.</p>
<p>The Tesla Roadster is a low-slung, electrically powered two-seat sports car that can be recharged from a household powerpoint for less than $12. With a range of almost 400 kilometres, depending on driving style, that equates to as little as 3¢ a kilometre.</p>
<p>However, supercar status still comes with a supercar price tag - owning one will make at least a $206,000 dent in your wallet, and that's before on-road costs are added.</p>
<p>Tesla, a seven-year-old US motoring industry upstart, opened a sales and servicing network for the Australian market this week. The move makes its Roadster the first electric production vehicle on sale to the public in Australia.</p>
<p>You need to service the Roadster only about once a year, and the service technician will come to you rather than rely on you to drive the vehicle into a workshop.</p>
<p>Tesla's US-based vice-president of communications, Ricardo Reyes, said the company would initially set up a showroom office and major servicing centre in Banksmeadow, with service technicians based in other cities that are ready to go wherever the car is parked.</p>
<p>''Tesla's viewpoint is that you don't need to have a shop or service centre on every block to make it work,'' Mr Reyes said. ''It's not a very efficient sales model for a company as small as us.''</p>
<p>The electric soft-top can reach 100km/h in less than four seconds, putting it inside the same performance bracket as more expensive brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati.</p>
<p>Instead of the fuel-heavy V8, V10 or even V12 engine fitted to conventional supercars, the Tesla has 6831 mobile phone-style batteries feeding energy to a single electric motor and a gearbox with only one gear.</p>
<p>Its top speed is a staggering 212km/h and the Tesla can travel 394 kilometres between charges.</p>
