The inquiry into Australia's spy services will find there was a failure of intelligence before the Iraq war and the Bali bombings, and will recommend a boost to intelligence analysis and training.<p />The much anticipated outcome of the inquiry, conducted by Philip Flood, a former intelligence chief and secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will deliver two reports to the Prime Minister, John Howard, this week.<p />One report will be classified, while the other will be for public consumption.<p />Canberra sources say Mr Flood made a detailed examination of the performance of the intelligence agencies before the war and their ability to identify Jemaah Islamiah as a threat before the Bali bombings in October 2002.<p />On both counts, it is understood, he found there was a failure of intelligence. In the case of JI, the blame lies largely with the Australian agencies and the way they interacted with the US.<p />Before the Iraq war, most mistakes were made by US and British agencies that share information with Australia. <p />However, it is understood that Mr Flood finds Australian agencies failed to analyse the information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction rigorously enough to establish its bona fides.<p />As foreshadowed by the Herald, Mr Howard gave testimony before Mr Flood, as did the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer.<p />The intelligence community is awash with speculation that the Office of National Assessments, the premier intelligence agency that reports directly to Mr Howard, will be substantially enlarged in the wake of the report.<p />The office was sharply criticised by an earlier parliamentary inquiry into the intelligence services after it hardened its position on Iraq before two speeches in which the Government recommended invasion. One was made by Mr Howard in February 2003, the other by Mr Downer in September 2002.<p />The inquiry found the changes disturbing and unexplained.<p />Mr Flood, a former head of the ONA, is expected to report on whether there was any politicisation of the agency or the Government applied direct pressure on the spy agencies.<p />A source close to the inquiry said: "There's a large focus on trying to look forward. There's quite a few recommendations on what can be done to improve the intelligence community and the quality of the advice."<p />It is understood that many of those recommendations focus on the recruitment, training and management of intelligence officers.<p />The report finds there are inadequate language skills in crucial areas. These are thought to be Arabic and other languages especially important in the war against terrorism. Further training and skills development in relation to Islam and terrorism are also believed to be recommended.<p />It is also understood that Mr Flood finds that some intelligence officers are blocked from advancing to the upper echelons of the six intelligence agencies, with senior positions being handed out to bureaucrats instead.<p />Mr Flood closely examined five of the agencies: the Office of National Assessments, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.<p />The performance of ASIO, which is responsible for domestic intelligence, was touched on but not scrutinised, sources say.<p />Senator Hill told Meet the Press yesterday that Mr Flood would examine issues including the extent of overlap between agencies and the depth of their resources.<p /> Water police drafted to terror front line - Page 2
