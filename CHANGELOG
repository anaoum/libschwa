0.4.0
* Don't distribute _config.h (whoops).
* Added `SCHWA_LIKELY` and `SCHWA_UNLIKELY` macro definitions to wrap around `__builtin_expect`.
* Made `--help` more helpful by adding a `--short-help` flag on all core tools (#14).
* Made `dr-count` behave more like `wc` when multiple input files are provided (#15).
* Corrected argument parsing for optional arguments (#17).
* Upgraded the Unicode database data from 6.3.0 to 7.0.0.
* Upgraded docrep reader and writer to use wire protocol version 3 (utilising the newly-added distinction between bytes and UTF-8 strings within MessagePack).

0.3.0
* Allowed `dr-count` and `dr-grep` to skip incomplete documents (#6).
* Corrected bug lazy docrep reading to ensure that it reads the desired number of bytes (#5).
* Many `dr-*` command-line tools now support multiple input files (#3).
* Renamed `dr-ui` to `dr-less`.
* Corrected construction of nested command-line options full name in help text (#11).
* Corrected a missing byte consume when reading msgpack data into a dynamic runtime structure (#9).
* Packaged re2 and cityhash into libschwa. re2 was added as full regular expression support wasn't added to gcc until 4.9, which hasn't become mainstream yet.
* Corrected bug where Ann subclasses were not destructed and re-constructed when stores were reused between reads.
* Added `dr-offsets` to output the byte offset of each document in a stream. Useful for debugging.
* Corrected `--help` to dispatch to each tool instead of being consumed by `dr` (#2).
* `dr` now lists the available tools it can to dispatch to (#1).
* Added UnicodeString support for docrep fields.
* Added schwa::unicode namespace for all Unicode related things, including UnicodeString and Unicode-equivalent ctype functions.
* Added docrep sequence tag denormalisaing and renormalising functors.
* Allow dr::Slice<T> to be iterated through using a C++11 foreach loop.
* Added homebrew formula for easy installation on OS X.

0.2.2
* Added an explicit include check in configure.ac for all used C++11 header files.
* The special command-line flags --help and --version no longer result in a non-zero exit status.
* Removed the need for dr::Pointer<T> and dr::Pointers<T>.
* Added the ability for command-line options to optionally fallback to a positional argument value for filling if an explicit flag was not provided.

0.2.1
* Initial public release.
