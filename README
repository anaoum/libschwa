1: Compile

  $ make depends
  $ make

= Gotchas =

* Running on versions of Mac OS X may mean you don't have clang available in xcode.
  * Download binary (tested with LLVM 3.1) from http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.1
  * Unpack and add the bin directory to $PATH

= Building, deploying and installing source distributions =

1: Build a virtualenv
  virtualenv --distribute ve
  source ve/bin/activate

2: Build the source distribution (or just run publish.sh)
  ./ve/bin/python setup.py clean sdist
  cp dist/*gz /n/ch2/var/www/sites/downloads/packages/pypi/schwa
  ./ve/bin/python setup.py clean --all

3: This can be installed in another virtualenv directly or as a "requires" item by pip from the schwa index.
  ./ve/bin/pip install schwa --extra-index-url http://downloads.schwa.org/packages/pypi --upgrade
