====== libschwa ======

=== Dependencies ===
libschwa is written in C++11, and as such, you will need a compiler that supports C++11. The
autoconf macro which detects compiler support for this is ./m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4.

The distributed processing components and binaries are only built if libzmq >= 3 is found.

The debug builds are linked against gperftools if they're found on the system.


=== Compiling a release version ===
libschwa is built using autotools so the standard compilations steps apply.

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check (optional: runs the unit tests)
  $ make install


=== Development ===
To generate the configure script initially, or any time that you change the build dependency
structure, rerun ./autoreconf.sh.

  $ ./autoreconf.sh

This runs the appropriate autotools command. Once you have a configure script, compile the source
in debug mode (-O0 -g). If you'd like the resultant binaries in one place, you might want to setup
a temporary workspace to build libschwa into.

  $ D=/tmp/`whoami`/working
  $ mkdir -p ${D}
  $ ./configure --enable-debug --prefix=${D}
  $ make

Running the unit tests can be done with `make check`.

  $ make check

The debug builds are linked against gperftools if they're installed on your system. See
https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/wiki/GooglePerformanceTools for instructions on how to use the
memory and CPU profiling. If you'd like to not link against these libraries but they are installed
on your system, update ./src/lib/Makefile.am and rerun ./autoreconf.sh.

The doxygen documentation can be built by `make docs`. The configure script currently does not
detect if you have doxygen installed or not.
