<p>BULLDOGS forward Michael Hodgson can see the funny side of the ''freak incident'' now - that moment when he ran out against South Sydney a fortnight ago and   collapsed onto the turf at ANZ Stadium.</p><p>
''Just another saga in my illustrious career,'' Hodgson quipped. ''I think I fell with a bit more grace than a sniper shot.</p><p>
''My mate Benny Roberts showed me about 10 times on replay. I fell quite gracefully for a 110-kilogram baboon.''</p><p>
Hodgson jokes about it now, but it was serious  at the time.  He  has never fainted, so there were serious concerns when he  inexplicably  collapsed just moments after coming off the interchange bench.   His wife, Sally, watched the coverage  from her family home in Canberra.</p><p>
''She was concerned because I've never fainted or had any history of anything of that nature,''  the journeyman forward said. ''It wasn't ideal. It was a bit concerning for family and friends, but I'm all right.''</p><p>
The cause remains a mystery. The 31-year-old, who will retire at the end of the year, was put through a battery of tests, but  medicos are none the wiser.</p><p>
 ''My blood pressure and everything was fine,'' he said. ''I was fit as a fiddle. Nothing sinister. The doc was just looking for some closure on it.  They said it was one of those things, just a freak incident.'' </p><p>
 The Bulldogs have the bye this weekend, but Hodgson was cleared to  return to the  field against the Windsor Wolves in the NSW Cup last night.</p><p>
   ''It was weird,'' he recalled. ''Rapid-fire. I came straight on - two hit-ups, one tackle and I'm out!</p><p>
''I said to Kev [coach Kevin Moore], 'If you're only as good as your last two touches, you'd have to pick me'.</p><p>
''There has been some healthy banter. Hodko [halfback Trent Hodkinson] reckons he was talking to me. It's worthy. Quite bizarre.''</p>
