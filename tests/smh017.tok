The former chief executive of Ford , Jacques Nasser , and the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank , John Schubert , will push their respective cases this week on why they should succeed Don Argus and become chairman of Australia 's biggest miner .

Succession planning for one of corporate Australia 's most prized positions is under way even though Mr Argus , who turns 71 next month , is yet to indicate when he is likely to retire .

Dr Nasser and Dr Schubert , the two most likely if BHP is to appoint a chairman from internal ranks , are reported to be scheduled for interviews with the company 's succession planning team this week.

Both have their backers , but Dr Nasser is believed to have the support of Mr Argus , who has been chairman since 1999 .

But Dr Schubert 's resume is impressive , and he is perhaps more suitable for the role .
He is a former chairman and managing director of Esso Australia , a former president of Business Council of Australia , and has a doctorate in chemical engineering .

BHP refused to comment on the interviewing process but has said before that succession planning is `` well in hand '' .
It is thought Mr Argus may depart at BHP 's annual meeting , to be held in Brisbane in November , or make his intentions known then .

The timing hinges not only on finding a replacement but also the advancement of BHP 's $ 116 billion iron ore deal with Rio Tinto , a crowning achievement for Mr Argus .

The succession speculation comes as the miner prepares to tell the market that it will not meet its full-year iron ore production forecast of 130 million tonnes .
It is expected Wednesday 's fourth-quarter report will show output of about 127 million tonnes .

In May BHP 's iron ore chief , Ian Ashby , indicated it was unlikely to reach its target .

`` That 's a direct consequence of the safety events , '' he said .

BHP 's safety record has come under scrutiny because of five fatal accidents since July last year .

Poor weather conditions also affected production , although not as much as Rio , which announced last week a substantial boost to June quarter production following a rain-soaked March quarter .

Iron ore delivery to China eased last week as Stern Hu , an Australian executive at Rio , and three colleagues remained detained for their roles in the recent bitter round of iron ore negotiations , which China says constitute serious criminal breaches .

Rio describes the claim that it bribed Chinese steel mill executives as `` wholly without foundation '' .
Iron ore pricing to China is still unresolved , well past its June 30 deadline .

As well as BHP , Woodside Petroleum , Santos , Woolworths and OZ Minerals are market heavyweights that will publish quarterly data this week .
