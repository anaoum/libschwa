THINGS are warming up for Indophil Resources , the Melbourne explorer that 10 years ago hitched its future to a copper-gold exploration project discarded by WMC in the Philippines .

The Tampakan project in the pineapple-growing southern island of Mindanao now ranks as the biggest undeveloped copper-gold resource in South-East Asia .
Its resource base contains 11.62 million tonnes of copper and 14.56 million ounces of gold .

Back when no one was interested in copper , Indophil struck an option deal on Tampakan with the Brisbane-based MIM , now part of Xstrata 's global resources empire .
The deal gives Xstrata the right to secure a 62.5 per cent stake in Tampakan .

With hindsight , the exercise price of about $ 50 million looks a bargain , given that the world is running a bit tight on large-scale development projects for the booming red metal .

Speaking from Manila , Indophil 's managing director and former WMC geologist , Tony Robbins , said there seemed little doubt that Xstrata would take up the option .
When it does , Indophil will be left with 32.5 per cent stake .

Xstrata has until the end of September to make a decision , which will coincide with the release of an Indophil feasibility study into a $US 1 billion ( $ 1.33 billion ) development of Tampakan as an annual producer of 200,000 tonnes of copper and 100,000 ounces a gold from late 2010 .

Mr Robbins said he had no regrets about the low-cost nature of the option .
