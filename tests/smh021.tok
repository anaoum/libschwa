It was a lavish function all about looking back at the club 's 135-year past and to honour those stars of different eras , but Sydney coach Paul Roos hopes the words of some of the Swans ' legends may impact on the club 's immediate future .

After what Roos described as `` one of the most disappointing games in the last seven years '' , it may not have been the best mood-setter for the Swans ' inaugural Hall of Fame dinner , where 23 former greats were honoured and inducted .

Roos even declared after their 61-point loss to Carlton , it would be `` disappointing to front up to the Hall of Fame after a performance like that '' , but reflecting on the night yesterday , where several past greats told today 's players how much they appreciate them and enjoy watching them fight each and every week , he feels it may help some of his younger players in terms of the future .

`` Yeah I think it was good for the players , '' Roos said .
`` It would have been nice to have all 48 players there [ only the 22 players from the Carlton game attended ] .
For the players to hear the respect in which they are held from the past group for the efforts they have been able to put in for the last six-and-a-half years , was pleasing for the group .

`` But equally they know the responsibility and that things can drop off quickly , so even for the younger guys it 's great to know the bar is at a pretty high level and as a club you 've got to try and remain at a high level even when you bring younger kids in .
I think it 's a good message that the past players were getting across to the younger group and hopefully , in some ways a function like that can fast-track the development of some of those kids as well .

`` A pleasing thing is that you are always mindful of what your fans are saying and the amount of comments last night [ from fans as well ] about how great it was to see Jesse White doing well , and Nick Smith doing well on Eddie Betts , and so on , so I think there 's a genuine appreciation there of what we are trying to do . ''

Sydney 's youngsters were good on Saturday , and it was actually many of the more experienced players who turned the ball over at crucial times resulting in Carlton scores or momentum shifts .
Roos said the senior players need to not get frustrated and stick to their roles .

`` I think there 's always frustration as a coach when we have been so competitive and so good for so long , and all the coaches are competitive , so that 's our job just to continue to drive the group and make sure their standard remains high , whilst being aware of where we are as footy club , '' Roos said .

`` It 's a combination of not putting too much pressure on them but putting enough on [ so ] that we keep those standards high while understanding we have got seven or eight young guys playing in the team .

`` A lot of our senior players probably committed a lot of the turnovers and mistakes , and whether they are mentally at a different level this year to past years ... it 's hard to tell or whether just that combination of not knowing where those younger players are going to be or trying to bring them into the game , it 's hard to tell .
But it was unusual to see some of those mistakes form the senior players .

`` I think the balance we had yesterday was good 14 experienced guys and eight younger guys and I thought the younger guys were our better performed players , and what we have to get across to our senior players is not to get frustrated and think you have to do anything extraordinary .
It 's a bit of a domino effect because if they stop doing their roles , they think they have to do more , it actually hurts the team rather than helps the team . ''

Defender Ted Richards has played his last game of the season after suffering broken ribs , a punctured lung and bleeding from inside his chest while backing into a marking contest with Carlton 's Brendan Fevola .
Richards caught Fevola 's knee in his back during the contest in the final quarter , and was taken to hospital after the match .

He will remain in hospital for two to three days with a chest drain and will need ground transport when appropriate back to Sydney .
Swans doctor Nathan Gibbs confirmed Richards will need a minimum of six weeks ' recovery .
