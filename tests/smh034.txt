Big names like Levi 's and Coca-Cola are becoming players in music , writes Julian Lee .

If music is the new medium , then Levi Strauss is attempting to own it .
Rather than sponsor music festivals or events , the iconic jeans brands is going one step further and is signing up Australian bands and releasing songs under its own Levi 's label , Levity .

A single by its first act , New Zealand band Cut Off Your Hands , has been the most played track on Triple J for the past two weeks , leading Levi 's Australia 's most senior marketer to declare the initiative a success after a fortnight .

Over the course of the next year , the brand expects to sign up at least two more acts , promote their work and , if the band agrees , star in Levi 's marketing .

Levi's is aware of the fine line that exists between helping the music industry and exploiting it , brand director Steve Williams says .

`` What is really important is that we see this as giving something back to the music industry .
What we do n't want to do is to parasite off the artists . ''

Not that that appears to be a problem .
Initial talks with the music industry , which has always had a fickle relationship with marketers , have yielded surprising results ; the artists Levi 's is talking to are more than happy to appear in its marketing or public relations , says Williams , who adds that they are not contractually bound to do so .

`` We thought it might be the other way round , '' he adds .

Williams says Levi 's wants to `` immerse '' itself in music , rather than `` just write a cheque for a sponsorship and walk away '' , and that his research is telling him that young Australians would accept Levi 's entry into music because it has `` credibility '' .

The brand has been worn by musicians ranging from Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones to Massive Attack and Wolfmother .

Levi 's is just the latest brand to use music as a marketing platform .
Starbucks was the first brand to launch its own record label , Hear Music , earlier this year .
Paul McCartney recently announced he was bypassing his label , Capitol Records , to launch his latest album , Memory Almost Full , with Starbucks .

Commentators say the match between brands and music is a natural fit and they expect more alliances to be formed .
Music companies are looking for new revenue streams while they wait for digital sales to close the gap on the drop in CD sales .

For their part , brands are exploring new ways to reach consumers and engage with them in a world of widespread media fragmentation .
Music , with all the loyalty and the passion that it engenders , is emerging as the new medium .

Coca-Cola is in the fourth year of its Live 'n Local music program , which puts on music gigs around Australia ; Jack Daniels has been sponsoring an awards night that pays tribute to live Australian music , and most recently Toohey 's Extra Dry has entered the fray with a competition that fosters emerging Australian talent .

John Rash , executive director of marketing and events company Peer Group Media , says few brands are able to find a meaningful role in music that music lovers will appreciate .

`` They will not like you if they see it as just another way to interrupt what they love doing most , which is listening to music , '' he says .

He cites Absolut 's collaboration with Lenny Kravitz in which the singer `` brought the vodka brand 's values to life through music '' as an example of an irrelevant marketing stunt .
`` You need to be doing things that people genuinely want , and I do n't think there were a lot of people out there thinking ` I wonder when we are going to hear Lenny 's take on Absolut come out ' . ''

Through Peer , Tooheys Extra Dry created a competition to find the best emerging Australian bands by allowing punters to vote on its uncharTED website and broadcasting the three play-off gigs and grand final on MTV .

To date , 1400 bands have competed and 300,000 votes cast in the second round that ended last week. The winner , which will be announced in October , gets a recording contract with Sony BMG Red Label and an appearance at The Big Day Out .

`` UncharTED is contributing to their culture , rather than just sitting there as a brand , '' Rash says .

For Levi 's , Levity is a long-term investment in the brand and Williams is not expecting results overnight .
`` How it pays back in the long term is hard to measure .
We do n't expect to be selling jeans off the back of this , but in two , or maybe three years ' time we hope to demonstrate to them [ the music industry ] that we are serious about this .

`` There may well be a knock-on effect to the brand equity , and higher brand equity will eventually translate into sales , but it is the brand that comes first and selling jeans second . ''
