Southern Highlands producers have a champion with a counter punch.<p />Highlands Fresh<p />92 MAIN STREET, MITTAGONG, 48711370.<p />Open Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, Sat 7am-1.30pm.<p /><p />When it comes to supporting local products, Jamie MacDonald is as fervent as a Queensland Origin fan. <p />In his shop with huge glass windows and a glowing sienna-coloured wall, he sells spanking fresh fruit and vegetables. Sadly, though, most of these don't come from the Southern Highlands, where farms are being sold for weekenders at a rapid rate.<p />Instead, MacDonald - who's often confused with near-namesake Sydney provedore Barry McDonald - does a daily run to the Sydney markets.<p />He uses his 16 years of greengrocer savvy to present piles of pristine Swiss brown mushrooms, tiny baby bok choy, claret-red treviso, knobbly jerusalem artichokes and trendy cavalo nero. Dotted between these mounds are horseradish, turmeric, chillis and golden shallots.<p />When he can, MacDonald sells potatoes from a local farmer (sebago, kipfler, spunta, nicola and jersey royals) and mushrooms from Noel Arrold, who farms his enoki, shiitake, shimeji and wood ear in a tunnel between Mittagong and Bowral. In season, MacDonald has spinach and cos lettuces just picked that morning on a nearby farm. <p />Where his local pride shines most is in the new pantry section of his brightly lit shop. He is a fan of Annie Wilson and her Harvest Ingredients range of 15 easy meals and marinades in bright stylish packets. Other local names on his shelves include jams from Alpine Berry Farm and Cuttaway Creek, Doodles Creek mayonnaise, Cedar Creek apple juice, Deliciosa biscuits, honey from Bees in Bowties and Highland Apiaries, and Fine Taste Bowral's fudge.<p />In the fridge he has local milks, yoghurts and cream from Country Valley. He has soups and casseroles from M & B Food and Catering, co-owned by the chef Martial Cosyn of the Blue Cockerel in Mittagong. <p />He also has olive oils, vinegars, pasta and a full line of pulses, nuts and grains, as well as some Simon Johnson items, Pastabilities and Herbie's Spices.<p />As we take in the ranges, in come Cippango's Debbie Reyes and Alison Brown, who make jams, syrups and much-sought-after panforte and pan pepato. They're here not to monitor their products (MacDonald says Cippango and Alpine Berry Farm are his big sellers) but to do their shopping. <p />Trading during the week is quiet but steady. On Saturdays, visitors from Sydney make up 65 per cent of the customers. "I don't rely on [the weekend business]," MacDonald says, "but it is a bonus."<p />Until last year, MacDonald had two other shops, in Bowral and Moss Vale. He sold these, though they still carry his trade name, to concentrate on his wholesale business - he supplies most of the good restaurants in the region - and the Mittagong outlet. <p />He plans to put in a deli counter. You can be sure it will have local duck confit, cakes and cheeses.<p />Best buys <p />Harvest Ingredients Moroccan lamb $7 pkt, above; M & B minestrone $9/800g; Noel Arrold's chestnut mushrooms $3.50/100g.
