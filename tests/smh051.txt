The body language when Sol Trujillo met the Communications Minister , Helen Coonan , and the Finance Minister , Nick Minchin , last week might have been instructive because , from all accounts , the new Telstra CEO 's attitude towards the prospect of tougher regulation as the trade-off for T3 has been hardening since he joined the company .

Trujillo was always going to have a different approach to regulation and the regulator , the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , than his predecessor , Ziggy Switkowski .
That is partly because of new circumstances , with T3 and freedom from the politics of majority government ownership on the horizon , but would also be cultural .

Trujillo comes from the US industry , where the natural response to regulators is aggression characterised by litigation .
Even before he arrived , senior Telstra executives were predicting Telstra would become far more active and belligerent in defending its position on regulatory issues .
Nothing that has transpired since , in the earliest days of Trujillo 's tenure , has changed that conviction .

Indeed , if anything , it has hardened .
Trujillo is said to have been taken aback by the extent of the challenges the group is experiencing in its core fixed-line businesses .
He will be even more determined that Coonan 's review of the regulatory context in which Telstra operates does not make it more difficult for the group to defend its turf .

The issue for Telstra is that in the past year , it appears , the dam it had built around its fixed line , or public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) , developed a leak .
After years of holding its numbers of lines in service and maintaining , although not building , the PSTN revenue base , last year 's decision to lift line rental charges as part of an ACCC-encouraged rebalancing of rental and call charges produced a structural response from Telstra customers .

PSTN revenues started falling as the number of lines in service started reducing and call revenues started tumbling at double-digit rates .
In the nine months to March the net effect of the rebalancing was a loss of $ 300 million of revenue and an acceleration of substitution of fixed-line services by wireless and broadband .

In the long run , while Telstra 's share of the wireless and retail broadband markets is far lower than its share of fixed-line telephony , that is not necessarily a disastrous outcome , given most broadband is delivered -- and will be delivered for the forseeable future -- over the PSTN 's copper network .
At worst , Telstra will get a wholesale margin on that traffic -- although it is relinquishing 50 per cent-plus margins in the process .

In the near term , with the pressure to produce near-term performance in the lead-up to T3 acute , Trujillo will be focused on slowing the erosion of the group 's highest-margin revenue pool .
He is not going to be receptive to any plans Coonan may have for increasing the regulatory burden on the group .
In that , he will have an ally in Minchin , who is focused on maximising the T3 proceeds .

Coonan reportedly believes Telstra can cope with extra regulation on the basis it still generates the great bulk of the sector 's profits .

Telstra 's profitability relative to its competitors is often cited as a reason for regulating it more aggressively and intrusively , although the ACCC is charged with regulating its behaviour -- not its profitability .
The reason for deregulating the industry was not to destroy or limit Telstra 's profitability but to generate efficiency gains and consumer benefit through competition -- which has occurred .

There is an expectation Coonan 's review will deliver more regulation and more intrusive regulation , although perhaps not quite as intrusive and heavy-handed as the operational separation that the British regulator , Ofcom , recently negotiated with BT .
She has also indicated the retail price cap regime and many of the other features of the eight-year-old regime will remain largely in place .

Coonan is naturally being urged by Telstra 's competitors to strangle the group with new regulation before T3 , despite the practical reality the issue of Telstra 's ownership is separate to the issue of its regulation .

Nevertheless , given the need for regulatory certainty in the lead-up to , and aftermath of , T3 , it makes sense to review and , if necessary , change the regulatory framework at this point .

Unhappily , it appears unlikely Coonan will do anything radical .
The current regulatory environment was established to regulate a very different Telstra in a very different competitive environment .

There is no argument its near-monopoly in fixed-line telephony dictates it should be regulated .
But the rapid structural changes in the sector and the shift in emphasis from the regulated old telephony services to the more competitive new suggest that it should be regulated differently , and with an eye to a wireless and broadband future rather than the past .

The emphasis should probably be on more effective access to the copper network and its exchanges than on price controls or costly ( and probably ineffective ) attempts to synthesise structural separation of its retail , wholesale and infrastructure components .

If the hemorrhaging in the PSTN has continued to accelerate -- PSTN revenue fell 4.8 per cent in the March quarter -- it would be difficult to argue that competition is not biting or that retail price controls and even tougher regulation remain necessary .

If Trujillo is confronted by the prospect of tougher regulation of Telstra 's core at the point where that core is under more pressure than at any time in its history , the elements for a confrontation between the new CEO and his minister are falling into place .
