Peter Reith has disputed Tony Abbott 's assertion that the NSW Liberal Party should take the flak for the Coalition 's narrow loss at last year 's federal election , saying other states must also take the blame .

Briefing the Liberal Party federal executive yesterday on his post-election review , Mr Reith said Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia must also accept responsibility .
There were swings away from the Coalition in all three states and a combined net loss of two seats .

`` Looking back , it was n't just NSW 's fault , '' a source quoted him as saying yesterday .

After the election , a frustrated Mr Abbott lamented the Coalition making a net gain of just one seat in NSW .
He said the party would have won at least three more and he would be prime minister had NSW preselected candidates earlier .

Mr Reith acknowledged the shortcomings in NSW in his report .
`` Factionalism has weakened the branches and membership throughout NSW and weakened our campaigning capability , '' he said .
`` We certainly can win more seats in NSW at the next election . ''

He lists Robertson , which had been held by Belinda Neal , as one of those seats which should have been won last year .

The seat was won by Labor 's Deborah O'Neill .
Mr Reith said the party should have run the former minister , Jim Lloyd , who lost to Ms Neal in 2007 .

Mr Abbott had also criticised strategy in Banks and Lindsay but Mr Reith said the reasons the Opposition Leader gave were not so clear cut .

Mr Reith recommended the state and federal divisions collaborate on preselections but , as a last resort , the federal executive should be given powers to override the state division and finalise a federal preselection .

The Reith review contains 34 recommendations , which the executive referred yesterday to an implementation committee .

Sources said about two-thirds were likely to be adopted without controversy .
These included giving higher priority to policy development by reinvigorating the Advisory Committee on Federal Policy and by increasing transparency in the areas of fund-raising and the party 's finances .

Mr Reith also proposed measures to enhance the democracy of the party such as allowing for a directly elected president , introducing plebiscites for preselections in those states which do not have them , such as NSW , and introducing a trial system of primary elections for preselections , as NSW Labor is doing .

It is understood that these recommendations were less effusively embraced yesterday and , a source said , would most likely be left to wither before a committee .

`` Most state divisions are happy with the way they do their preselections , '' the source said .
