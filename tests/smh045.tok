Things were a little tense at the Parents and Citizens meeting .
Uniforms were on the agenda , or , more specifically , tracksuit pants .
Some parents were concerned their daughters ' legs were feeling a tad cold .
They suggested tracksuit pants as part of the winter uniform for girls .
`` Buy some thicker woolly tights , '' I felt like saying , but did n't .

I believe the issue goes deeper than warmth .
I believe some parents find the current uniform high maintenance .
Tracksuit pants are a wash-and-wear affair , needing no separate wash , no scrubbing , no ironing and no darning .
Despite this very tempting domestic advantage , I ca n't help feel that fleecy , baggy pants with elasticised waists just do n't make the grade .

There are those that will argue `` clothes do n't maketh the man '' .
True , but there 's something about rows of students in striped ties , crisp shirts , blazers with crests , tartan dresses and boaters that makes old men nod in approval and convinces pregnant women to ring principals to make a booking for their unborn child .

Call me old fashioned , but uniforms make children presentable .
They may be cheeky and unruly , but they look good .
They may hang around shopping centres , or not stand up for the elderly on buses , but at least those pregnant women can identify the school , ring up the principal and cancel that booking .

Uniforms are not fashionable -- most of us would rather be caught wearing trackie daks than wear one .
But that 's the whole point .
There are no labels .
Everyone wears the same .
Without a strict , detailed tracksuit pant policy , our playground will turn into those sporting ticks , pumas and three stripes versus those wearing less prestigious brands .

Of course , there 's the issue of equality .
If the girls wear the trackie pants in winter , then the boys will have to be allowed to ditch the grey pants and shirts .
And then thought must be given as to what to wear with the tracksuit pants .
Because the current sport uniform has a white polo , this will probably be suggested , which brings us back to the whole issue of separate washes .

Economics will certainly be raised .
Is it cheaper to wear tracksuit pants five days a week or nice smart uniforms ?
I have yet to do a cost analysis .
However , anecdotally , my daughter 's playground escapades in kindergarten meant she 'd come home with a scraped knee peering through a big round hole at least once a week .
And because my darning skills leave a lot to be desired I spent a small fortune buying tights to see her through winter .

Despite my pleas about not letting the presentation of the school decline , the pro-trackie daks parents were unconvinced .
Then someone suggested navy tailored pants as a compromise .
We all agreed they would be warm and , more importantly , presentable .
