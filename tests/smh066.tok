The robbed generations

`` Children in care , '' writes Arthur Chesterfield-Evans ( Herald , July 15 ) , `` need governments prepared to learn from their past mistakes and failures . ''

How can the community and the Department of Community Services learn from the past when no-one bothers to ask how older state wards fared when released from wardship and were left to fend for themselves , without to this day any support services ?

As former state wards we could tell you the devastating consequences that we , and many others , still live with today : such as the effects of abandonment , institutionalisation , emotional neglect , insecurity , minimal education and the lack of identity that results from loss of family .

Like the `` stolen generations '' many state wards lost all contact with their family of origin and their ethnic and cultural background , directly through government intervention .

There is also the stigma of being a state ward , which has helped to silence the thousands of people who have grown up feeling that somehow it is their fault that nobody cares for them .

It 's time that society acknowledged , and learnt from , the legacy that past state wards carry with them through their lives .
Only then can we bring about the changes in the system which will prevent children in `` care '' from entering the same damaging cycle .

Heaven-sent

The Bledisloe Cup match at the weekend demonstrated what I have been trying to tell my seven-year-old son Oliver for months that rugby union is a far superior game to rugby league .

Consider the similarities : both games use egg-shaped balls and oblong fields with H-shaped posts , and are played by large , hairy men with metal spikes on the bottom of their shoes .
You can be injured , maimed or even killed in either code .
Both games are referred to as `` footy '' , `` football '' and even `` rugby '' .
Both games attempt to extract the same qualities from its players courage , strength , speed , agility , strategic excellence and teamwork .
And yet , consider the differences : one game actually achieves all this , the other does n't come close .
One game flows from one play to the next , with the phases building upon each other in orchestrated intensity ; the other game is a stop-start succession of individual `` hit-ups '' .

But try explaining that to a seven-year-old. I could n't , so I took him to the game on Saturday night and it was an experience neither of us will ever forget .

In the end , when Jonah scored in the corner a mere 25 metres from where we sat , I turned to look at my son 's face , and I knew he understood .

One game is played in heaven .
The other one ai n't .

Sanctionmonius

Having perceived George Speight as a frontman from early in the piece , not to mention being at a bit of a loss as to why the Australian media has forsaken the basic rule of following the money trail , your editorial opinion ( July 15 ) that `` it 's time for sanctions '' causes me to ask against whom and/or what ?

Three major industries , ostensibly of Fiji , come to mind .

Sanctions against the tourist industry would send Australian dollars elsewhere , but might not sit well with Australian capital investments of a higher order .

Much the same might be said about Fijian sugar and Australia 's CSR .

The Australian sorry , Fijian garment industry would have to find another offshore island with equally low wages , but that 'd be just outsourcing by another name .

All in all , a ban on footy players looks the safest bet , though that would have to be taken up with the great council of sportsmen .

Nope , it would have been far better to have followed the money trail and let the chips fall where they lie .

E.D. Webber , July 15 Blue Haven .

The Foreign Minister , Alexander Downer , says that sanctions against Fiji are inappropriate because they will cause harm to innocent Fijians and destroy Fiji 's economy .

However , the Government supports the much more severe sanctions against Iraq which have killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people .

Why are Fijian civilians worth protecting while Iraqi civilians are not ?

Driver training

Four young people die in a tragic road accident and the kneejerk reactions are : speed kills ; speed limiters for all cars ; ban four-wheel drives .

I 'm no big fan of four-wheel drives ( I think they are a menace ) but would a bus have been better ?
Or a motorcycle ?
Another small car , so even more people are killed ?

It is too easy to blame everybody and everything else .
After all , inappropriate speed to the conditions is what kills and no amount of legislation or draconian speed limits will stop somebody going around a 35 km/h corner at 60 km/h .

Only adequate driver training on the road and in the classroom will address this problem .
Keep the parents out of driver education leave it to the experts .

Switch solution

Perhaps the problems of anti-child and child care would be ameliorated if children were fitted with switches .

This , however , is not a complete solution as a child would probably cease growing while switched off , thus prolonging the problem .
