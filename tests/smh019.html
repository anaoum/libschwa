THE centrepiece of the Federal Government's so-called education revolution may be worse than useless, a visiting American researcher says.<p />Before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd vowed to spend $2.3 billion rewarding parents who installed or bought home computers.<p />He later said his decisions would be evidence based.<p />Jacob Vigdor, of Duke University, North Carolina, has conducted what is probably the world's biggest study on the effect on maths and reading scores of gaining a home computer. He finds "statistically significant" evidence that it sends them backwards.<p />"Children in homes with computers tend to do better than those in homes without there's no doubt about that," Professor Vigdor told the Herald.<p />"But there could be other reasons. Those homes also have a lot of other things other homes don't have, and often have more educated parents."<p />He examined the performance of students before and after their home gained a computer. This meant examining students from less well-off homes. The better-off ones already had computers.<p />But Professor Vigdor told a seminar at Australian National University he did not think this was an important limitation.<p />Professor Vigdor found that acquiring a computer at home made end-of-year results for year 3 to year 8 students in North Carolina "significantly worse" in reading and maths. These results were spread over five years.<p />"The bad effects fade somewhat over time, but even after five years they are still negative. I am not saying go out and burn all the computers.<p />"If you want to buy junior a computer with your own dollars, that's fine ... but it's another thing when we talk about spending public dollars."
