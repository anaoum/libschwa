A new supercar goes on sale in Australia this week , but owning one wo n't cost you a single visit to the petrol station .

The Tesla Roadster is a low-slung , electrically powered two-seat sports car that can be recharged from a household powerpoint for less than $ 12 .
With a range of almost 400 kilometres , depending on driving style , that equates to as little as 3 Â¢ a kilometre .

However , supercar status still comes with a supercar price tag -- owning one will make at least a $ 206,000 dent in your wallet , and that 's before on-road costs are added .

Tesla , a seven-year-old US motoring industry upstart , opened a sales and servicing network for the Australian market this week .
The move makes its Roadster the first electric production vehicle on sale to the public in Australia .

You need to service the Roadster only about once a year , and the service technician will come to you rather than rely on you to drive the vehicle into a workshop .

Tesla 's US-based vice-president of communications , Ricardo Reyes , said the company would initially set up a showroom office and major servicing centre in Banksmeadow , with service technicians based in other cities that are ready to go wherever the car is parked .

`` Tesla 's viewpoint is that you do n't need to have a shop or service centre on every block to make it work , '' Mr Reyes said .
`` It 's not a very efficient sales model for a company as small as us . ''

The electric soft-top can reach 100 km/h in less than four seconds , putting it inside the same performance bracket as more expensive brands such as Ferrari , Lamborghini and Maserati .

Instead of the fuel-heavy V8 , V10 or even V12 engine fitted to conventional supercars , the Tesla has 6831 mobile phone-style batteries feeding energy to a single electric motor and a gearbox with only one gear .

Its top speed is a staggering 212 km/h and the Tesla can travel 394 kilometres between charges .
