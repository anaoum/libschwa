Sydney Symphony

Contemporary Music Festival Verbrugghen Hall , July 16 & 17

The first weekend of the Sydney Symphony 's Contemporary Music Festival kept one foot firmly in the 20th century .
This weekend it strode resolutely into the 21st exploring chamber works composed after 1975 and a string of world premieres .

Saturday 's chamber music concert allowed the soloists of Sydney Symphony to explore timbre and pitch with far greater sophistication than is possible in a larger ensemble .

Liza Lim 's 1996 duo , Inguz , delved deep into the sonorities of the cello and clarinet .
Toru Takemitsu 's Rain Spell , written in 1982 , had a wider palette but , like Lim 's work , gazed hypnotically into the sound world of micropolyphony .
And in Gyorgy Ligeti 's Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet , written in 1982 , the sostenuto , strident overtones and harmonics spinning out from densely clustered chords could have stripped paint .
In spite of some wobbly moments with ensemble , this was the most impressive work in the program , featuring outstanding solo playing which underlined the high calibre of the principal players .
To finish , Elizabeth Campbell gave a lively performance of Luciano Berio 's Folksongs , accompanied by a slick seven-piece ensemble .

Michael Smetanin 's Mysterium Cosmographicum was the first of three world premieres in the final concert .
It revolved around a concertante group made up of soloist Lisa Moore , a second piano ( played by a fearless Josephine Allan ) , harp and percussion .
This percussive `` continuo '' group created blocks of sound using repeated notes , giving the work an underlying motor rhythm .

The rest of the orchestra , by contrast , exploited their ability to elide pitch and rhythm .
It was an original and compelling work and Moore played with power .

As for Kim Bowman 's Alchemia I it seemed he had put the orchestral repertoire of the 20th century into a washing machine and set it to spin .
It suffered from overdense scoring but , like the white wash with that red sock left in , was smattered with colour and insight .
The five lyrics of Lee Bracegirdle 's Ammerseelieder ranged from philosophical to mocking , like Mahler without the orchestral acuity .
Baritone Didier Frederic sang well , although he struggled against overindulgence in the brass writing .

For lessons in orchestration , you might well look to Wolfgang Rihm .
His Spiegel und Fluss ( Mirror and River ) is a beautifully written work , brilliantly played by the Sydney Symphony .
For this , much credit goes to Reinbert de Leeuw , conductor and artistic adviser for this series .
The balance and ensemble was immaculate and the entry of the off-stage trumpets was a dramatic turn of sound , rewarding the brave audiences of the festival with an outstanding performance .
