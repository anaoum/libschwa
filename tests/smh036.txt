FORD has confirmed its Geelong engine plant will close in 2010 , and blamed the closure on a `` fundamental and permanent '' consumer shift away from big cars .

The president of Ford Australia , Tom Gorman , said the company 's new Falcon , due for release in March , will initially be powered by the existing six-cylinder engine that has been built in Geelong for almost 50 years .

But from the beginning of next decade , the Falcon , and Ford 's other locally built vehicle the Territory offroader , will be powered by an imported US-built 3.5-litre V6 engine .

About 600 workers will lose their jobs .
Ford says it will try to redeploy as many as possible before the closure of the plant , which has been the most important employer in Victoria 's Geelong region .

The announcement triggered a political row over the large-scale job cuts that have been occurred in the vehicle manufacturing sector over the past two years or so .

The Opposition Leader , Kevin Rudd , said Ford 's decision was a terrible development for Geelong and for the future of Australian manufacturing .

He said that if Labor was elected it would fast-track its planned review of existing industry policy for the automotive sector and make changes within three months of taking office .

`` I do n't want to be prime minister of a country where we do n't manufacture things any more , '' Mr Rudd said .

But the Minister for Industry , Ian Macfarlane , pointed to the Government 's automotive competitiveness investment scheme which was delivering $ 4.2 billion in assistance to the sector between 2005 and 2015 .

`` This is quite an isolated decision , '' he said .
`` This decision by Ford is about placing a more efficient , lower emission engine in their new Falcon and it is a decision which secures the long-term production of the Falcon in Australia . ''

The federal and Victorian governments announced they would provide $ 24 million to limit the fallout from the engine plant closure by encouraging other businesses to expand and create new jobs in Geelong .

Mr Gorman said he would look at the possibility of assembling the new V6 engine in Geelong .

A fall in demand for big cars has seen production at Ford 's engine plant sink to 70,000 engines a year .
Global production of the new US-sourced V6 will reach 1 million units by next decade .

Locally-made vehicles make up just over 19 per cent of car sales in Australia , compared with 36.1 per cent in 1998 .
It is believed it would have cost Ford $ 30 million to $ 40 million to make the Falcon compliant with new emission laws , which come into force in Australia on July 1 , 2010 .
Mr Gorman said Ford was restructuring in response to `` changes in consumer behaviour '' and growing demand for more fuel efficient models , including small imported cars .

Ford told its dealers this month it was looking at assembling a small car , most likely the European-designed Focus , at its Broadmeadows plant .
