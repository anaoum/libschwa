Vincent d'Indy

Iceland Symphony Orchestra , Rumon Gamba ( Chandos )

Had French music taken a different direction , Vincent d'Indy might well have occupied a position comparable with that of Richard Strauss in Germany .
As it is , the Germanic influence in his music makes him seem less original than the great French innovators , Debussy and Ravel .

His large tone poem , Jour d'ete a la montagne ( Summer day on the mountain ) , recorded here with colour and care , has obvious parallels with Strauss 's Alpine Symphony , which it predates by 10 years , both works exploiting the ruse of describing a mountain day in place of musical structure .

D'Indy 's vocabulary has some of the subtlety of Debussy ( particularly in the darkness of the outer sections) , the brilliance of Strauss and the solemnity of his beloved Gregorian chant .
La Foret enchantee ( The Enchanted Forest ) is earlier and less distinctive , while Souvenir is a touching tribute to his dying wife .
