The Page Turner ( 2006 ) , SBS Two , 9pm

Melanie Prouvost is a talented girl , the only child of a working-class butcher and his wife , who practises the piano daily in an effort to secure a scholarship at a prestigious musical academy .

On the day of her crucial audition , the proud and determined 10-year-old is obliged to perform for a panel of arbitrators headed by noted concert pianist Ariane Fourchecourt .
During Melanie 's recital , Mlle Fourchecourt breaks her concentration to sign an autograph , causing the youngster -- already intimidated by the situation -- to lose her nerve and botch the rest of her performance .
She is `` Failed '' .

Shattered , she returns home , locks the keyboard of her piano , junks her bust of Beethoven and calls it quits .
All or nothing ?
Fade to black .

A decade later , now a twentysomething woman , she reappears , applying for a job with a prestigious law firm in Paris .
Melanie 's enthusiasm and an outstanding CV help win her a clerical position in a section headed by the partnership 's top attorney , Jean Fourchecourt .
The husband of guess who .

The grown-up Melanie , played effectively by Deborah Francois , most assuredly has an agenda and smoothly parlays her position as a reliable menial into one of dependability -- offering her services to Mlle Fourchecourt ( Catherine Frot ) , first as a music tutor to her son , Tristan , and later as her personal page-turner .

Ariane , who has suffered injuries in a car accident and , consequently , a loss of confidence , is preparing her comeback and welcomes the felicitous assistance of the younger woman , who , of course , she fails to remember .

The pressures of stardom , combined with her uncertainty and loneliness ( things are n't entirely fabulous with the aloof Jean ) , make Melanie 's planned revenge all the sweeter -- and icier -- in an elegant psycho suspenser that employs Shostakovich , Bach and Schubert to ratchet up the mood .

Denis Dercourt 's production ( his My Children Are Different screened a few weeks ago ) is as lean , measured and precise as a concert recital demanding nuances of emotion and judicious accentuation .
There 's a good deal of both Losey and Chabrol , plus echoes of Isabelle Huppert 's Erika Kohut from Michael Haneke 's The Piano Teacher ( 2001 ) .

Francois , as the older Melanie , offers a confounding blend of sociopathic exactitude and innocent intimation -- cold as chilled nylons .

The sense of austerity , such a pivotal factor in Un Coeur En Hiver ( 1992 ) , is also evident here and so are the malevolent undertones of Pasolini 's Teorema ( 1968 ) .
