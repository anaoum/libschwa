Western Bulldogs spearhead Barry Hall will announce his retirement within the next 24 hours after informing coach Rodney Eade of his decision yesterday .

The former St Kilda and Sydney Swans 2005 premiership captain is expected to play out the season , honouring his two-year contract .

Hall was selected by the Bulldogs in the 2009 draft following a number of on-field indiscretions -- most notably his seven-week suspension for striking West Coast 's Brent Staker in 2008 -- that led to his retirement from the Swans in July that year .

He told Eade yesterday that his 283 games ( 88 for St Kilda , 162 for Sydney and 33 for the Dogs ) had taken their toll on his body and he could n't face up to another season .

Hall , 34 , kicked five goals and was among his team 's best players in Sunday 's loss to North Melbourne at Etihad Stadium .
That took his tally from nine games to 24 . He kicked 80 goals last season -- 73 in home and away games -- and was runner-up to Richmond 's Jack Riewoldt in the Coleman Medal as well as earning his first All-Australian selection since being honoured in 2004 , '05 and '06 .
