Sydney will inch closer to a cashless network of toll roads when the M2 moves to an e-tag-only system early next year .

Five years after it first said it wanted to introduce cashless tolling on the M2 , the road 's owner , Transurban , has agreed with the government to scrap toll booths during the current road-widening project .

The Roads Minister , Duncan Gay , said the government would look to bring in cashless tolling on the M5 and the Eastern Distributor , but would have to negotiate with the road 's owners .

`` Once we do this one they 're the next ones on our agenda , '' Mr Gay said .

The minister also said he would be open to changing the toll structure on the Harbour Bridge , where motorists are charged a premium during peak hours .

`` I believe that if you have no alternative , it is like congestion charging , it is an unfair toll , '' he said .
`` If someone 's got an idea to make that fairer , but still return the same sort of money , I would be happy to look at it . ''

Announcing the shift to cashless tolling on the M2 , the acting NSW Premier , Andrew Stoner , said : `` The days of fumbling for coins in your car ashtray are over . ''

`` For motorists from the north-west it will be a quick trip straight through , no merging of lanes , 100 km/h all the way through , '' Mr Stoner said .

Mr Gay admitted that shifting to cashless tolling was a relatively minor reform , though he questioned why the previous Labor government did not introduce it .

But the minister did hold out the promise of some significant changes to road pricing .

Asked if he would consider ways of lowering tolls on the M2 during the upgrade program , which has made congestion worse on the artery , Mr Gay said he had asked the Roads and Traffic Authority for a report into the options available to him .

`` The issue of a reduced toll during construction certainly is one that we have asked about and it is ... certainly one that I would be willing to look at , '' Mr Gay said .

The roads minister even promised to look at a more ambitious proposal , suggested most recently by Infrastructure Australia , to bring all Sydney 's toll roads under common ownership , and equalise the charges so they are consistent across the city .

In theory , this would benefit residents who regularly use the heavily-tolled corridor of the M2 , Lane Cove Tunnel and the Harbour Bridge .

`` There are a lot of people suggesting that that 's something that should be looked at in the future , to have an equalisation to make it fairer , '' Mr Gay said .

`` It is certainly something I believe needs to be looked at and when I meet with Infrastructure NSW I 'm going to suggest as one of the things that they should be doing . ''

The infrastructure lobby group , Infrastructure Partnerships Australia , called on the government to act on the proposal to integrate tolls across Sydney to remove the burden on motorists from the north west .
