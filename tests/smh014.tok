A young storyteller strives for an honest approach , writes Helen Greenwood .

Julian Shaw has never played the part of the wunderkind even though he has every right to .
At 15 , he was writing for the movie magazine FILMINK .
At 16 , he started filming his first documentary , Darling ! The Pieter-Dirk Uys Story .
At 21 , he began work on his second film , Cup of Dreams , about the All-Blacks , to be released in time for the Rugby World Cup in 2011 .
At 23 , he is picking up prizes at festivals in Berlin and London for Darling ! .
He has also acted in , written and directed All Blacks Do n't Cry , about the New Zealander John Kirwan 's battle with depression at the height of his rugby career .
The half-hour drama has been sold to Australian and New Zealand TV .

As if that were n't enough , the engaging , thoughtful Shaw has just released Modern Odysseus , a `` photo-novel '' starring the actor Colin Friels , and will discuss it at next month 's Byron Bay Writers ' Festival .
On Friday , Shaw will appear at the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers conference and exhibition in Sydney .

The conference will also hold a free screening of Shaw 's award-winning Darling ! .
The story of how the New Zealand-born Shaw made a documentary about Uys is as compelling as his take itself on this cutting-edge satirist , playwright and novelist .

Uys , in the guise of his character Evita Bezuidenhout , the Edna Everage of South Africa , had been lampooning and battling apartheid since 1981 , before turning his sights on to another target , the AIDs epidemic .

Shaw was a restless high-school student when his step-mother took him to see Uys 's one-man show at the Sydney Opera House in 2001 .

Shaw was mesmerised by `` this funny , bald Afrikaner man '' , his message and his mission .
`` If I look at my heroes all through my life , they are people who speak out , and Pieter falls into that tradition .
He said stuff that he should or could have been killed for .
I thought it brilliant how he criticised the apartheid government .
I thought , I have to know everything about this guy and I have to know about this country . ''

Shaw went backstage and invited himself into the life of an iconoclast who visited high schools around South Africa , telling young people the truth about AIDS .
`` [ Uys ] was talking about people my age and had seen a million schoolkids .
It clicked for me and I thought , ` This has to be my first film ' . ''

Shaw negotiated with his performing arts school , the McDonald College in North Strathfield , to deliver a 95-point result for his final year , borrowed money and flew to Cape Town in 2002 .
`` I 'll go there and I 'll figure it out , '' is how Shaw remembers it .
He did n't realise that over the next five years , he would make six trips to South Africa , finishing the film with funding from the Aids Trust of Australia , at a cost of $ 130,000 .
Oh , and scoring 98.5 for his HSC .

Shaw 's one-hour documentary looks at Uys 's self-appointed campaign since 2001 .
Unpaid and without backing , Uys travels the country telling teenagers about condoms , the transmission of the disease and the lies he believes are perpetrating a genocide on black people .
Uys reveals his extraordinary ability to use comedy , mockery , pathos and empathy to poke fun at politicians and tear off the veils of ignorance .
Using a little archival footage and a lot of respect for his subject , Shaw reveals Uys 's pain for his country and his own complex past .

Although Uys is the film 's central figure , Shaw is in the background and sometimes on camera , filming and making notes .
`` There are little drawings throughout from my notebooks , just trying to make sense of this country .
I thought it was a nice way to structure the film , which had to come from a personal point of view .
When I saw [ Uys 's ] show , I knew nothing about South Africa and I try to be honest about that in the film .
It 's such an intimidating subject , South Africa , and the African experience , the many problems . ''

He wrote Modern Odysseus while he was making Darling ! .
`` It was my respite in a way .
I had been writing the text as a book and something was missing .
Suddenly the idea came to me of having film frames and I thought that is what it is meant to be a photo novel to tell the story in images as well as words . ''

Modern Odysseus is about a day in the life of a corporate high-flyer ( Colin Friels ) whose world has come crashing down .
He realises he has lost his imagination and sets out to find it and bring it back to life .
`` The original Odysseus explored the world out there but this guy is exploring his inner world and you go under his skin .
I felt we needed to see what he was seeing .
It 's almost a picture book for grown-ups .
It 's very simple in some ways , '' Shaw says .

Shaw has taken Darling ! to South Africa , Canada , Poland , Israel , Germany , Britain and the US .
`` I am aware that I have done things at a young age .
But I do n't see that as a badge of honour .
I think people respond to Darling ! and the book because they are good and they are from the heart .

`` Things happen at different points in your life .
If I were 50 and had seen [ Uys 's ] show , I might have had the same response : I 've got to make a film about this guy .
I tried not to be limited by the fact that I was 15 . ''

Darling ! The Pieter-Dirk Uys Story screens at 2pm on Thursday at the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers at the Convention Centre , Darling Harbour .
Julian Shaw will be the keynote speaker at 9am on Friday .
