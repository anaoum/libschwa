The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement has been easily approved by the US Congress , and next month may be passed by our Parliament , but that does n't prove it 's in our economy 's interests .

One man who doubts it 's in our interests is Peter Urban , Australia 's consul-general to the US from 1989 to 1994 and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 's chief economist in 1995 and 1996 .

In response to my challenge to economic rationalists to stand up and be counted on the free trade deal , Urban sent this article , which I run intact :

Would Australia gain from a free trade agreement with the United States ?
Of course we would .
Indeed , the gains would probably be in the range of $ 4 billion to $ 10 billion per year , in line with the 2001 and 2004 estimates by the Centre of International Economics .

That , however , is irrelevant to the Australia / US Free Trade Agreement ( AUSFTA ) negotiated between our government and the US .
AUSFTA is an FTA in name only .

At best , AUSFTA is a weak preferential trade agreement .
And if you really want to know if Australia gains under AUSFTA , the relevant question to start with is : does the United States really want an FTA with Australia ?

The answer to that question is : of course not !
To put it simply , a free trade agreement with Australia is not in their national interest .
Indeed , a real FTA with Australia is almost the last thing the US wants ( although it may be just the thing the cosseted US agricultural sector needs ) .

The United States is a competitor with Australia for most of our major agricultural exports .
A real FTA would deliver significantly increased Australian exports to the US for sugar , beef and dairy products .
Although US consumers would gain , the US farm lobby would be in uproar at just the thought of this .

Similarly , US manufacturing competitiveness has been declining and US trade deficits in manufactures have been widening for the last three decades .
Under a real FTA , Australia 's net trade deficit in manufactures would narrow , possibly quite sharply .

Under AUSFTA , this wo n't happen .
Because of rules of origin restrictions , our manufacturing export gains will be limited .

However , Australian manufacturing tariffs are already low and AUSFTA will artificially bias Australian manufacturing imports in favour of higher cost US producers and away from lower cost European and Asian exporters ( many of whom use Australian inputs ) .

The area where the United States retains a global competitive edge is in services and goods embodying intellectual property -- software , films , music , many capital goods , pharmaceuticals etc .

And the last thing the US wants for these IP goods and services is free trade .
The fact is , the US wants monopoly or oligopoly pricing for these goods and services , not competitive pricing .

The US has been pursuing its IP trade agenda quite single-mindedly for more than the last decade .
In the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations , for example , the US threatened to block final agreement unless all parties agreed to an extension to the life of patent protection .

Similarly , the US opposed Australian moves in the late 1990s to allow parallel imports of CDs , video games , software and DVDs .
Yes , the US claimed this was because of concerns over the risk of increased piracy , but Australia already had one of the strictest anti-piracy regimes in the world .

The real reason : US firms wanted to continue to extract artificially high prices .

Reinforcing this is the fact that the US has a culture of aggressive use of patents ( and patent enforcement ) and the US patent office is granting very broad patents ( for example , on double clicking ) for IT .

The result -- the US government and US industry are looking to trying to use IP protection as a major element in their strategy to protect the position of the United States as a major economic power .

It was for this reason that IP pricing was a make or break issue for the US in AUSFTA .
Without Australian concessions on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme , for example , the US would n't have agreed to AUSFTA .

To ensure the agreement was approved by the US Congress , Bob Zoellick , the US Special Trade Representative , reassured US pharmaceutical companies and other major IP producers that the US got what it wanted .

For us , the message is simple .
We are significant consumers of IP goods and services .
Indeed , Australia 's fast uptake of IP has been a major driver of our rapid productivity growth over the last decade or so .

For this to continue , Australian industry needs access to these goods and services at competitive prices .
Yes , it is in our long-term interests that US producers of IP earn reasonable returns .
If they do n't , they will reduce their investment in new IP .

It is not in our interests , however , to help the US institutionalise its market power in IP markets .

The bottom line : AUSFTA is just another case of that hoary old marketing ploy of `` bait and switch '' .
We were promised a real FTA but that 's not what we will get if we sign this FTA .

Rather than support AUSFTA , we should be telling our trade negotiators to try to deliver a real FTA with the United States .

And if they do n't think they can , they should stop wasting their time and our money and focus on the Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations instead .
