Jack Egan

1941 -- 2007

Jack Egan , one of nature 's sportsmen , turned himself into perhaps the most illuminating historian of Australia 's national game , cricket , and a chronicler of the Australian frontier .

Born to Bryan Egan and his wife , Marcia ( Marce ) , Jacko , as he was known , spent his early life on Mount Harris , near Warren in western NSW , a property selected by anancestral convict-turned-squatter in the late 1830s .

After his parents ' divorce , Egan was left in his father 's care at Mount Harris from the age of five .
A succession of governesses arrived to educate him , and were fired when they fell in love with his father , who never remarried .
When sent , at nine , to board at Tudor House , near Bowral , Egan could n't read .
He revelled , however , in the company of boys his age , and finished as dux of the school .
At The King 's School at Parramatta , where he played in the firsts at cricket and rugby and was a leading tennis player , he became school captain .

With money too short for him to go to university , Egan applied to the Sydney accountancy firm Perry Johnson Beardsmore and Wilton .
When one of the partners , Harry Beardsmore , asked about his maths , Egan had to answer that it was not his best subject .
`` How about tennis ? '' asked Beardsmore , thinking of a forthcoming tournament between accountancy firms .
Egan 's prowess on the court secured him the job .

He turned out to be a pretty good chartered accountant , nonetheless , working on audits of the Bank of NSW , the AMP Society and other clients .

Egan 's sporting life continued : he became a leading batsman for I Zingari ( Italian for `` the Gypsies '' ) , the Australian offshoot of a famous old amateur club in Britain .

And on the northern beaches one summer he met Ros Ridley , the 19-year-old daughter of another old farming family near Forbes , with whom he was to share a close , enduring marriage .
In 1970 , the Egans were in Britain when news came that his father had died , aged 54 .
They returned to take over Mount Harris , in the middle of a drought , with debt and death duties piled overhead .
Working on audits to provide a cash flow , Egan set about the task of rescuing Mount Harris .

He also approached Max Suich , the editor of The National Times , pointing out that the weekly had no one writing from a rural point of view .
Suich was surprised to find Egan 's initial offering spoke out in favour of the Whitlam government 's slashing of tariffs , an alternative to the stance of the pro-tariff Country Party .
It was the start of a regular column that gave city readers a taste of the joys and setbacks of farming , mixed with an auditor 's grasp of economic realities .

`` The National Times was a deeply urban newspaper with a lot about politics , food , and wine , and here was this beautifully written voice from the bush , '' Suich said .
`` It 's a truism in publishing that the best people generally walk in ; Jack was one of them . ''

In 1980 the Egans moved back to Sydney , selling Mount Harris with regret , although it has since been bought by a second cousin , John Egan .
Boldly , Jack had decided to try a full-time writing career .
Securing rights to old newsreel footage , in 1983 he produced The Bradman Era , a book and video that drew on the recollections of the great Bill O'Reilly for its main voice narrative .

A flow of linked books and documentaries , published in collaboration with the ABC , followed .
They included Tennis -- The Greats in 1984 , with Adrian Quist 's voice , and The Story of Cricket in Australia ( 1987 ) .
In 1990 , a rare extensive interview with Bradman led to a 90-minute documentary .
His unauthorised biography of Steve Waugh , One Who Will , was published in 2004 and The Spirit of the Ashes last year .
He played regularly at the Royal Sydney Golf Club and served on its committee .
His years at Tudor House remained dear to him ; he served on its board and sent his son , Tom , there .

The white settlement of Australia increasingly drew his interest , too .
The book Buried Alive ( 1999 ) was a narrative drawn from the diaries of the first convicts and their guards , providing a fresh look at contact with the Aborigines when the fate of the new colony hung in the balance .
It will remain a valuable resource for the teaching of Australia 's history .

The same spirit illuminates When We Were Cowboys , a half-hour documentary Egan made about his mother 's second family and their life running Rokeby , a cattle station on Cape York , where the Aboriginal community carried on a largely traditional life .

Diagnosed with brain cancer , Egan kept writing for as long as he could .
Last summer he finished a book about a round-the-world yacht voyage by two Australians , which is now in publication .
He battled debility and welcomed visitors to the end , dying last week at 66 .

Jack Egan is survived by Ros , their three children , Caroline , Amy and Tom , three grandchildren , with two more on the way , and three siblings , Shaen , Lindy and Tim .
