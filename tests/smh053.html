What a wonderful world the commercial television networks inhabit. Most of us grew up with the notion that in any competition there can be only one winner. But in Tellyworld, everyone is a winner; and simultaneously, everyone else is a shameful loser.<p />This became apparent last week when the stations put out their interpretations of how Australians consumed TV during the first six months of this year. Here's how they reported the results. <p />Channel Nine: "Nine set to win 2005. At the mid-year point we have consolidated our position as Australia's number one network, strengthened our already consistent line-up of quality programming and will once again finish the year number one."<p />Channel Seven: "Seven building momentum as year unfolds. Seven is up in every audience demographic. The Seven network is the only network to deliver audience growth in the current television year." <p />Channel Ten: "Ten on top and ahead of 2004. Network Ten is in pole position in its core 16-39 demographic at the halfway mark of official 2005 ratings. Ten is substantially in front of the Seven and Nine networks in the year to date." <p />Pay TV: overall viewing up 14 per cent while free-to-air is down 2 per cent.<p />Noting a certain confusion, Seven came back for a second bite, saying its average audience was up by 125,000 viewers, while Nine's was down 53,000, Ten was down 69,000, pay was up 55,000 (across 40 channels) and SBS was up 11,000. It concluded: "The total television market has increased by 1 per cent overall in the five capital cities, which is equivalent to an extra 29,000 viewers watching TV."<p />Are they kidding themselves? No, they're all telling the truth. Each chose to use the demographics and time periods that gave it the best results.<p />Here's the bottom line: Australians over 40 seem to be watching more of Seven, SBS and pay TV than last year, while people between 16 and 39, particularly in Sydney, seem to be watching less TV, apparently distracted by the internet, DVDs, video games, and real life. The table at right shows the preferences of the quaint old-fashioned under-40s who stuck with TV this year.<p />You may find it scary.<p /><p />TV tops with the under-40s<p />1.
