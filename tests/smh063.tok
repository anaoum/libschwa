Susan , the woman raised in the central western town of Cumnock who became the wife of Leka , the pretender to the Albanian throne , died on Saturday in Albania .

`` Her Majesty Susan I Zog is no longer with us , '' spokesman Fluturak Germenji announced in Tirana , the capital .

He said she had died from a heart condition although a brother , John Cullen Ward , said in Forster that his sister was being treated for cancer .
She was 63 .

Born Susan Barbara Cullen Ward , she married King Leka in Biarritz in 1975 after meeting him at a Sydney dinner party .

Barry Everingham , a commentator on royal families who has represented Leka and Susan in Australia , said the marriage was a `` love match '' and King Leka would be devastated .
However , in many ways , she had led a sad life , moving from one country to another while her husband tried in vain to capture the crown once worn by his father , King Zog .

Susan , one of five children , attended the Presbyterian Ladies College in Orange , where she later taught art .

Her marriage at 34 to Leka followed a failed first union .
Guests at the wedding shouted `` Long live the king ! '' , then acknowledged the Spanish dictator , `` Long Live Franco ! ''

King Zog fled with his wife , Geraldine , two-day-old son Leka , and some of the Albanian treasury when Benito Mussolini , the Italian fascist dictator , occupied Albania in World War II .

After Zog died in 1961 , monarchist emigres declared Leka their king at the Bristol Hotel in Paris .

Leka denied being on the CIA payroll in the late 1960s and early 1970s and Susan later denied another common allegation , that her husband was an arms dealer .

The couple lived in Madrid until Spain expelled them when an arms cache was found at their home .
He had been arrested earlier in Thailand on charges of arms smuggling .

Leka and Susan went to Rhodesia , now Zimbabwe , until the whites lost power , and then to South Africa , where they lost diplomatic favours after Nelson Mandela won office .

Australian authorities refused to recognise Susan as a queen but , in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister , issued a passport in the name of `` Susan Cullen Ward , known as Queen Susan '' .

Leka and Susan returned to Albania a few years after communism crumbled in 1990 .
They were ordered out by the first democratically-elected president , Sali Berisha .

They went back in 1997 , when Leka lost a referendum on the monarchy that he claimed was manipulated .

Maureen Cullen Ward , a cousin , said yesterday : `` Susan was very nice , very clever , cool and with a great sense of humour . ''

Mr Everingham said : `` She was a woman of great dignity who became enamoured by her husband 's dream to return to the monarchy . ''
