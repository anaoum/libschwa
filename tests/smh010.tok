Brisbane can begin thinking about the huge task of rebuilding , after it was confirmed the worst of the flood crisis had passed .

The Brisbane River was expected to surge again at 4 pm today , but the waters continued to recede from the early morning peak of 4.46 metres .

While they may have to wait months before they can return to their homes , flood-affected residents have been assured the river level has begun its slow return to normal .

`` The river is falling and it will continue falling , '' hydrographer Russell Denton said this afternoon .

`` The worst is gone .
We 're not going to see a fresh rise . ''

Mr Denton said by 5 am tomorrow the river would decline to 3.2 metres , which is 0.3 metres below a major flood level .

The river was at 3.75 metres and falling at 3.42 pm .

Brisbane death

Brisbane residents have been given a tragic reminder to remain out of floodwaters , after a 24-year-old man was sucked into a drain in Durack .

The man 's death was the third confirmed today , along with the the discovery of a male body in Myall Creek near Dalby and another in a field in Grantham .

They take the death toll from this week 's flood crisis to 15 , while 61 remain missing .
There were `` grave fears '' for 12 of those , Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said .

Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the man found at Durack was trying to do the right thing by checking his father 's property , but his death had been avoidable .

She implored residents to stay out of floodwaters to avoid another tragedy .

`` This incident is not over .
Floodwaters are moving very fast ... it is still a very dangerous situation , '' she said .

The bodies of two men killed in Queensland 's savage floods are being flown from the Lockyer Valley to Brisbane this evening .

A Defence helicopter with the bodies was due to arrive at Nathan in the city 's south about 6.30 pm .

` Tourists ' causing problems

Main Roads Minister Craig Wallace said emergency services were becoming increasingly frustrated by people treating the floods as a `` tourist attraction '' .

Dozens of people arriving in their cars to rubberneck at the devastation are creating further waves of water , further damaging businesses and road infrastructure , he said .

Minister Wallace said dirty water was pushing into Brisbane properties as drivers ploughed through the murky floodwaters .

`` This is not a tourist attraction , it 's a tragedy , '' he said .
`` If you are not assisting the effort , please stay at home .

`` Our priority is to keep these roads clear for police , emergency services , and evacuees during our response and recovery stage . ''

Residents receive reprieve

Lord Mayor Campbell Newman today announced flood victims would be afforded $ 100 worth of water free of charge to clean their properties .

`` That 's a lot of water .
If you think of a normal gardening hose , one kilolitre of water is released after just an hour of watering and that equates to about $ 1.80 under today 's charges , '' he told ABC Radio .

Brisbane City Council will also give flood victims an extra 30 days to pay their rates bills .

The council will not operate parking meters or enforce timed parking zones and parking bays for 30 days in flood affected areas , particularly for those people who have moved their vehicles to higher ground .

Returning home may take months

Earlier today , the Premier warned that some Brisbane residents may not be able to move back into their flood-affected homes for months .

Residents in the Queensland capital this morning awoke to the good news the river has peaked at 4.46 metres , more than a metre below the predicted peak of 5.5 m .
The 1974 flood , the worst of last century , was 5.45 metres .

But while the news was better than expected , scores of homes have still been inundated , and thousands of Brisbane residents remain evacuated from their homes .

The Premier warned the state was facing a reconstruction effort of `` post-war proportions '' .
More than 15,000 residential and commercial properties have been affected by significant flooding .

Ms Bligh said people in evacuation centres may be able to look at their inundated homes `` some time '' over the weekend .

`` They wo n't be able to get in to clean them until they 've had electrical certification and are made safe , '' she told ABC Radio .

`` They may not be able to move back into their homes for literally months .
So , there is a very big dislocation effort we have to manage very carefully . ''

Almost 1000 people remain in evacuation centres across Brisbane .
The RNA Showgrounds at Bowen Hills is housing 647 people , with a further 323 at the QEII Stadium at Nathan .

Police have established another centre at the Kedron Wavell Services Club on Hamilton Road for people who cannot get to the other locations .

Life disrupted

As they try and cope with the flood crisis , Brisbane 's residents are having to deal with power shortages and supermarket closures .

Retailers have warned some supermarket shelves could remain empty for days , and people may struggle to buy staples , including dairy products and bread .

Power might not be returned to the CBD for days .

CBD at a standstill

The heart of Brisbane 's central business district has been engulfed by the flood that has devastated the city .

Floodwaters began entering the area yesterday and early this morning a knee-deep body of water covered much of Eagle Street , which houses Brisbane 's Stock Exchange and the Prime Minister 's city office .

The pool of murky water extends to the bottom of Creek Street , and up Charlotte Street to the Elizabeth Street intersection .

While the city 's corporate workers have abandoned the area , groups of onlookers have gathered to take photos of the remarkable scene .

Police warned people to avoid travelling to the CBD today unless absolutely necessary , and urged sightseers to stay away from the river because they could hamper emergency service workers .

Suburbs submerged

The suburbs identified as being the worst-hit by the flooding were Brisbane City , St Lucia , West End , Rocklea and Graceville .

Almost the entire suburbs of Yeronga and Fairfield have been consumed , with the water stretching at least three blocks from the river .

Rows of streets have disappeared , with the breadth of the water so great onlookers are being kept hundreds of metres from the centre of the devastation .

Countless homes are completely submerged .
At others , roofs are peaking above the water while still more homes have muddy water part way up their walls .
