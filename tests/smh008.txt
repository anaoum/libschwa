People taking pills to treat medical conditions may report health improvements even if they know they 're being given placebos , a new study suggests .

The placebo effect refers to the benefits experienced by patients taking placebo pills -- made from sugar -- during drug trials .

In such trials patients are not told whether they are taking real pills or placebos with no active ingredients , to ensure the medical benefits of a potential new drug are assessed rigorously .

But a small-scale study , published today in the science journal PLoS ONE , found placebos may work even without the deception .

Harvard Medical School associate professor of medicine Ted Kaptchuk and his team conducted a three-week trial of 80 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome .

They were divided into two groups , with one group given no pills , and the other given pills honestly described as `` like sugar pills '' .
They were told to take the pills twice daily .

Nearly twice as many patients treated with the placebos reported adequate symptom relief ( 59 per cent ) compared with the group taking no pills ( 35 per cent ) , according to the study .

The study claimed patients taking the placebo doubled their rates of improvement to a degree roughly equivalent to the effects of the most powerful irritable bowel syndrome medications .

`` Not only did we make it absolutely clear that these pills had no active ingredient and were made from inert substances , but we actually had ` placebo ' printed on the bottle , '' Associate Professor Kaptchuk said in a statement .

`` We told the patients they did n't have to even believe in the placebo effect -- just take the pills . ''

Although the study was limited in scope and would need to be confirmed by further research , he said the findings suggested there `` may be significant benefit to the very performance of medical ritual '' .

Senior study author Anthony Lembo , of the Harvard Medical School , said he was surprised with the results .

`` I did n't think it would work , '' he said .
`` I felt awkward asking patients to literally take a placebo .
But to my surprise , it seemed to work for many of them . ''

The study was funded by Harvard Medical School 's Osher Research Center and by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States .
