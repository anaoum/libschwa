Here is one of those strange letters that only ever appear in Column 8. In fact, it's hard to imagine it appearing anywhere else. Sam McNamee, of Greenhill, writes: "In the year 1952 I fitted a fully imported car air-conditioner to a Dodge motor car owned by James N. Kirby. I am curious to know whether this was the first car air-conditioner to be fitted in Australia." While we're at it, we want to know more about James N. Kirby.<p />"A letter received today from Energy Australia tells me that the company intends to do some work at our premises," writes Francis Buttle, of St Ives, "'between two (2) and twenty one (21) days from the date' of the letter. Can Column 8, of all the great Sydney institutions, perhaps explain why official letters always express quantitative values in terms both literal (two) and numeric (2)? Are there some people who only recognise numbers, and not words, or vice versa? Or is the word 'two' so difficult to comprehend that a number has to be inserted to clarify meaning? I don't get it. Do you? What is the origin of this odd practice?"<p />Nicolas Harrison, of East Lismore, reports that he "received a small package from South Africa yesterday. Stuck to two sides of the box were plastic envelopes containing stamps. The final count was 2340 10-cent stamps, of which 50 had been franked and the remainder cancelled by a black texta pen. I know this is a PB, however I wonder if it is a world record?" It may well be but how would we ever know? Does it count if the stamps aren't licked and stuck?<p />The disappearing rainbow debate rolls on. "If a rainbow is formed by the refraction of white light through raindrops," asks Wendy Lander, of Wimbledon, in Britain, "then is its disappearance caused by our eyes reassembling the colours into white light?" Bill Henderson has muddied the waters considerably by asking for an explanation for this: "Flying above cloud over the Mediterranean during the Second World War, there were times when a perfectly circular rainbow would appear on the cloud surface below, with a silhouette of the aircraft in the middle."<p />Still on the subject of optical phenomena, Jim Jacobs, of Engadine, has sent us a mountain of information about the forthcoming lunar eclipse, which we pass on in edited form. If you've never seen a total lunar eclipse, it's worth jotting this down in your diary - it's quite a sight. "From Sydney the whole eclipse will be visible," Jim advises, "except due to bad weather, on Tuesday, August 28. At 17:54 the moon will be 5 degrees above the eastern horizon - penumbra of the earth begins to fall on the moon. 19:52, at 29 degrees, totality begins. At 20:57, at 38 degrees, mid point of totality. At 21:22, 46 degrees, totality ends. The duration of totality is 1 hour and 30 minutes." It's time to start planning your eclipse party. Is Nick Lomb throwing one at Sydney Observatory? We'll find out.
