Holden Racing Team driver Todd Kelly will carry the momentum of wins in the past two rounds of the V8 Supercar Championship when he lines up for the Queensland 300 this weekend -- the first of the season 's long-distance races .

But Kelly is not interested in speculation about whether he can win three consecutive events .
Rather , he has his sights set on the bigger picture and his objective is to wrest this year 's title away from Ford rival Marcos Ambrose .

Survival with a respectable points score is the plan , as he realises it would be easy to lose his chance of winning the title through being distracted by chasing a hat-trick of wins .

Kelly 's latest wins have come in the Shanghai and Darwin rounds , each run over three heats , but Sunday 's event at Queensland Raceway near Ipswich is the home turf of Ambrose 's Stone Brothers team .
It is also their nominated test track , and where they tested last week .
The round will be run as a one-driver , 280-kilometre race .

Kelly says this is the best position he 's ever been in when it comes to having a crack at the title and is not being distracted by speculation of the hat-trick , which is so low on his priority list that it does n't register .

`` Queensland 's going to need a different approach to the other races , '' Kelly said yesterday .
`` All of your eggs are in one basket .
And with the momentum I have I want to carry that on , and to do that I 'll have to be more careful about this race .

`` It will be a case of survival ; if I can come out in the top five it will be good for my championship chances , and anything better than that will be a bonus . ''

Under this year's scoring system , a driver 's worst round is dropped from his points tally .
On that basis Kelly is second to Ambrose on the championship ladder , a rather better position than is indicated by the current total scores that have him fourth with 870 points .
All up , Ambrose has 980 , Steven Richards 893 , and Ambrose 's teammate Russell Ingall 877 .

`` The tracks I struggle at , we have already been to , '' said Kelly .
`` We tend to go well at the tracks that are coming up after Queensland -- Oran Park , Sandown and Symmons Plains , and Mark ( Skaife ) and I tend to go well at Bathurst , and Phillip Island is the track we test at . ''

Kelly reckons the pressure is mounting on Ambrose , whose only victory this year was in the opening round in Adelaide , and who finished ninth in Darwin and fifth in Shanghai .

`` The second half of the season will be very tough and competitive and Marcos will be under more pressure than he 's had in the last couple of years , '' he said .
`` Realistically , there are five guys capable of taking the title away from him . ''

However , Ambrose won the race last year while Ingall has won the race twice and led Ambrose home in 2003 .
