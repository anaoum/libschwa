THE young Hockeyroos had to bravely settle for silver at the elite Champions Trophy tournament after going down 4-3 in a nail-biting penalty shoot-out to Argentina at Olympic Park yesterday.<p />Despite their heroics and claiming Australia's first medal at the event since 2005, the Hockeyroos will not contest the Champions Trophy for the first time in history next year, after being relegated from the tournament.<p />In a qualification farce, fifth and sixth placegetters China and England stay up while the Hockeyroos were rubbed out of the 2010 event in Nottingham because England are immune from relegation as hosts.<p />As England were exempt, relegation was decided on Olympic rankings, where Australia sits a lowly fifth, one spot ahead of England, who were beaten 7-0 by China in yesterday's play-off.<p />Hockeyroos captain Madonna Blyth unsurprisingly was upset.<p />"It's disappointing that you can come second and lose in a penalty shoot-out and all of a sudden you're not in the next year's Champions Trophy," said the 23-year-old, who was named player of the tournament. "But they are the rules and I think after this they'll have a bit of a look at them because a team that can come fifth can go through but a team that can come second can't.<p />"We're happy with what we did ... those kind of things can go either way, you prepare as best you can and on the day it can vary, it's disappointing to lose in a penalty shoot-out but you've got to win one way or the other."<p />Hockeyroos coach Frank Murray said he hoped the sport's governing body (FIH) might back-pedal from the decision to rub out Australia and instead include a seventh side in next year's tournament. "We'll pick our heads up and keep going," he said.<p />"You can't really change the rule but maybe there's an option for them to have a seventh team."<p />Asked if it would consider admitting Australia as a seventh team next year, an FIH spokesman said: "No way, but this situation is something that we'll have to look at."<p />The Hockeyroos, fielding seven tournament debutantes, performed well beyond expectations as they matched it with the top nations during the event, claiming the scalp of Beijing gold medallists the Netherlands, who finished third after beating Germany 5-2.<p />Argentina superstar Luciana Aymar hit home the winning penalty to secure the win after Hockeyroos Fiona Boyce and Nicole Arrold missed their shots.<p />Australian goalkeeper Toni Cronk saved one of the Argentine's penalty strokes, while Hockeyroos Casey Eastham, Blyth and Emily Hurtz scored after the match was locked at 0-0 after 15 minutes of extra time.<p />Kate Hollywood had the best chance to score for the home team in the 73rd minute but her off-balanced shot lacked power and Argentina's goalkeeper Belen Succi made the save.
