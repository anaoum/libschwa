Mickey Spillane

1918--2006

Mickey Spillane's first novel , published 59 years ago , told of the hunt by his hero , Mike Hammer , for the murderer of his best friend .
Discovering the killer is the beautiful woman whom he has fallen for , Hammer shoots her with a bullet to her naked belly .

The book , I , the Jury , ends with the infamous lines : `` ` How c-could you ? ' she gasped .
I only had a moment before talking to a corpse , but I got it in . ` It was easy , ' I said . ''

Spillane , who has died at 88 , kept this up almost to his end , despite having become a campaigning Jehovah 's Witness .
One of his last books , Something 's Down There , contains this : `` For a second he wished he had been packing his .45 and the piece was in his hand with the hammer back so he could turn and shoot her guts right out of her beautiful belly and it would finally be all over with for all time . ''

Most critics hated all this .
Malcolm Cowley called Spillane `` a homicidal paranoiac '' , attacking what he called his misogyny and vigilante tendencies .
The Times Literary Supplement called him `` nasty '' .
Even his father , a bartender , called his stories `` crud '' .
Spillane said : `` I pay no attention to those jerks who think they 're critics .
I do n't give a hoot about readin' reviews .
What I want to read is the royalty cheques . ''
He said he was `` the chewing gum of American literature '' , adding : `` I 'm the most translated writer in the world , behind Lenin , Tolstoy , Gorki and Jules Verne .
And they 're all dead . ''

Claiming sales of 200 million , he was certainly one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century and a leading light in the distinctively US version of crime fiction that began with Dashiell Hammett in the 1920s .
The `` hard-boiled '' detectives of Hammett with Sam Spade , Raymond Chandler with Philip Marlowe , and Spillane with Hammer , took the genre from the drawing room into the street .

Born Frank Morrison Spillane in Brooklyn , New York City , he grew up in New Jersey and attended college in Kansas , where he excelled at swimming before beginning his career writing for Batman and other comics .

When he came home from World War II , during which he was an army flight instructor , Spillane thought novels the best way to make money .
He referred to his readers as `` customers '' and called himself a `` writer '' , rather than an `` author '' , defining a writer as someone whose books sell .

He dashed off I , the Jury in a few weeks , some say nine days .
Viewed by some as a precursor to Clint Eastwood 's Dirty Harry , Hammer is a loner , contemptuous of the `` tedious process '' of the jury system , choosing to enforce the law on his own murderous terms .

The editors doubted the writing but not the market .
`` I knew it was going to be a bestseller , '' Spillane said .
`` There was nothing like it on the market . ''
He believed the army turned men into professional killers with a hatred for things .
He went straight into writing and let the hatred hang out .

Twelve more Hammer novels followed , including The Killing Man , The Girl Hunters and One Lonely Night .
Many were made into movies , including the classic film noir Kiss Me Deadly and The Girl Hunters , in which Spillane played the lead .
Hammer stories were also featured on television in the series Mickey Spillane 's Mike Hammer and in TV movies .

Spillane became a Jehovah 's Witness in 1951 and helped build the group 's Kingdom Hall in Murrells Inlet , South Carolina , where he lived the last half of his life .
Unlike the alcoholic Hammer , Spillane neither smoke nor drank and was a house-to-house missionary for the Witnesses .
He disdained what he saw as corrosive forces in American life , from antiwar protesters to the United Nations , and hated communists , often making them the bad guys in his books .

Besides the Hammer novels , Spillane wrote a dozen other books , including award-winning volumes for young people .
Done initially on a dare from his publisher , Spillane wrote a children 's book , The Day the Sea Rolled Back , about two boys who find a shipwreck loaded with treasure .
The Ship That Never Was was the story of two boys who discover a lost island .

Spillane received lifetime achievement awards from the Mystery Writers of America and the Private Eye Writers of America , even though crime fiction devotees thought his work declined after the Hammer novels .

He returned to Hammer after 20 years with The Killing Man in 1989 and Black Alley in 1996 , in which Hammer finally confesses his love for Velda , his long-suffering secretary .
Alas , because of doctor 's orders , they cannot consummate the relationship .

Survivors include his third wife , Jane Rodgers Johnson , a former beauty queen 30 years his junior; and four children from the first marriage .
